# Task PRD: TKT-164 — Andy Flower Training & Research — Level Up to 4.5/5

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Requester:** Founder
**Assigned To:** Andy Flower (Cricket Domain Specialist)
**Epic:** EPIC-003 (Phase 1: Governance Setup)

---

## Problem Statement

Andy Flower is rated 3.5/5 in the Sprint 4.0 performance review (TKT-160). His domain quality is excellent (tag validation graded B+, V2 cluster review approved, analytics research document is comprehensive). However, his delivery volume is low (3 tickets completed) and his mandate is too narrow — he validates but doesn't create.

The gap between 3.5 and 4.5/5 is not quality. It's **scope, volume, and proactivity**.

## Current State Analysis

**What Andy does well (keep):**
- Domain validation is thorough and authoritative (tag validation, V2 clusters)
- Cricket logic is accurate — catches real misclassifications (Parag PP_DOMINATOR, Rahane)
- Analytics research document shows deep understanding of novel metrics
- Veto power used responsibly — blocks with fixes, not just objections

**What's missing (close the gap):**
- Only 3 tickets completed in Sprint 4.0 — lowest volume among active agents
- Tactical insights in stat packs are generic — Andy should own making these specific
- No proactive insight generation — waits for validation requests instead of proposing insights
- Domain sanity sign-offs not formally recorded in Mission Control for most tickets
- No collaboration with Virat Kohli on editorial narrative despite overlapping mandates
- Analytics research document (Jan 25) has not been translated into implemented features

## Proposed Training Plan

### Phase 1: Mandate Expansion (Immediate)

1. **Own tactical insights in stat packs** — Andy reviews all 10 team tactical insights sections, rewrites generic insights to be specific and data-backed
2. **Proactive insight generation** — Andy proposes 3-5 novel insights per team that fans wouldn't know
3. **Editorial collaboration** — Andy works with Virat Kohli to ensure narrative matches cricket reality

### Phase 2: Research Depth (Week 1)

4. **Translate analytics research into features** — The Momentum Index, Pressure Sequence Index, and other metrics from `andy_flower_analytics_research.md` should be prototyped
5. **Coaching perspective layer** — Add "coaching notes" to each team's stat pack: what would a coach focus on? What's the team's structural weakness?
6. **Modern T20 tactics research** — Document evolution of T20 tactics (matchup bowling, impact players, batting intent metrics) for editorial use

### Phase 3: Process Rigor (Ongoing)

7. **Formal domain sanity documentation** — All domain sanity sign-offs must be recorded in Mission Control (not just verbal YES)
8. **Regular review cadence** — Andy reviews every generator output (stat packs, depth charts, predicted XIs) before they go to production
9. **Cricket truth gate** — Before any stat pack ships, Andy signs off: "This would make sense to a professional coach"

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Andy completes 8+ tickets in remainder of Sprint 4.0 (up from 3)
- [ ] All 10 team tactical insights reviewed and improved
- [ ] 3+ novel insights per team proposed and validated
- [ ] At least 1 metric from analytics research document prototyped
- [ ] Domain sanity sign-offs recorded in MC for all reviewed tickets
- [ ] Agent config updated to reflect expanded mandate
- [ ] Next performance review: 4.5/5 or higher

## Scope

**In scope:** Mandate expansion, research translation, editorial collaboration, process documentation
**Out of scope:** New agent creation, changes to other agent mandates

## Dependencies
- Virat Kohli retraining (TKT-161) should happen in parallel for editorial collaboration
- Stephen Curry available for analytics support on metric implementation

## Estimated Effort
Large (multi-deliverable across remainder of sprint)
