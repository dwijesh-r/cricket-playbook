  "description": "For the 51 players in IPL 2026 squads with no IPL 2023+ data, add T20 fallback data from other tournaments (BBL, Blast, PSL, CPL, SA20, The Hundred, etc.). The squad views already LEFT JOIN to all-T20 career data but generate_stat_packs.py never renders those columns. Implementation: 1) Render T20 columns in stat pack squad sections for uncapped players, 2) Add a separate 'Uncapped Watch' section per team stat pack showing T20 profile for players without IPL history, 3) Tag uncapped players in player_tags.json with T20-only flag. 34 of 51 uncapped players have meaningful T20 data. 17 have zero data anywhere.",
