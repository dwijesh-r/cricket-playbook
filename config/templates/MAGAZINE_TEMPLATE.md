Language: “tends to / historically / profile suggests”.

### Roles & players section
- Role archetypes (openers/finishers/enforcers/death bowlers)
- Players to understand (role usage, not hype)

### Tournament pressure points
Where matches swing; key overs; common failure modes.

### History tells us (careful)

## Hard cut order
1) Quick reference 2) Extra player page 3) One team “what to watch” page 4) reduce meta charts.
