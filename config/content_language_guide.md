## Purpose

This guide codifies the editorial tone for all Cricket Playbook content. It is the single reference for how we write, what we avoid, and how we calibrate voice across stat packs, depth charts, team previews, and all editorial output.

Every contributor and agent producing editorial content must follow these standards. Violations are flagged by Virat Kohli and enforced by Tom Brady.

## Core Principles

1. **Dry and witty.** Understated humor that rewards attentive reading. Think: a senior analyst who happens to be funny, not a comedian trying to analyze cricket.

2. **Professional but engaging.** Authority first, personality second. The reader should trust the analysis before they smile at the writing.

3. **Not too many puns.** Puns are allowed sparingly (1-2 per 1000 words max). They must feel organic, not forced. If you have to reach for it, cut it.

4. **Analogies welcome.** Cross-sport and real-world analogies are effective for explaining cricket concepts to engaged fans. Football (soccer), basketball, and business analogies work well. Keep them brief.

5. **Subtle dry humor.** Observations that are funny because they're true, not because they're trying to be funny. Understatement over overstatement.

## What TO Do

- **Use confident, declarative sentences.** "Bhuvneshwar's economy is elite" not "Bhuvneshwar's economy could be considered quite good."

- **Let data do the heavy lifting.** The best humor comes from presenting a surprising number and then letting the reader react.

- **Use short sentences for emphasis** after longer analytical paragraphs. "Full stop." / "That's the point." / "This is no longer a competitive fixture."

- **Vary sentence length.** Mix analytical depth with punchy observations.

- **Use *italics* for emphasis sparingly,** and for genuine contrast or surprise.

- **Write section headers that tell you something.** "Somebody Read the Memo" > "2025 Analysis"

- **The writing should feel like a conversation** with a very knowledgeable friend who doesn't waste your time.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **No em dashes.** Do not use em dashes (---). Use commas, colons, or full stops instead.

- **No exclamation marks in analytical sections.** Allowed in headlines only.

- **No food metaphors in clusters** (buffet, feast, menu, etc.). One food metaphor per 2000 words maximum.

- **No internet-speak.** Do not use "let that sink in", "I'll wait", "say it louder", or similar phrases.

- **No cliche metaphors** when a precise observation works better. Banned examples: "heat-seeking missile", "pressure cooker", "ticking time bomb."

- **No forced alliteration.**

- **No emoji in body text.** Emoji are allowed in data tables for visual indicators only.

- **Avoid "imagine" / "picture this" / "think about it" openings.**

- **Never use "breaking" or "shocking" or "stunning"** for analytical findings.

- **Do not stack metaphors.** One analogy per paragraph maximum.

## Sample Calibration

The following examples illustrate the difference between forced/punny writing and the dry, witty tone Cricket Playbook requires.

| Bad (too punny/forced) | Good (dry and witty) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "RCB murder pace bowling like it owes them money" | "RCB dominate pace bowling. Right-arm, left-arm, the result is the same." |
| "Krunal is a pressure cooker on legs" | "Krunal's 7.45 economy exists in its own postcode within this squad" |
| "PBKS have become RCB's personal stress-relief exercise" | "This is no longer a competitive fixture" |
| "David treats left-arm death bowling like a pinata" | "David dismantling left-arm death bowling at will" |
| "Let that sink in" | "The only bowling type where RCB underperform" |

### Additional Guidance

**Headers:**

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "2025 Analysis" | "Somebody Read the Memo" |
| "Bowling Overview" | "The Only Bowling Type Where RCB Underperform" |
| "Key Stats" | "Three Numbers That Explain Everything" |

**Sentences:**

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Bhuvneshwar's economy could be considered quite good" | "Bhuvneshwar's economy is elite" |
| "It's shocking how dominant they are!" | "They are dominant. The numbers leave no room for debate." |
| "Imagine a world where MI's death bowling actually works" | "MI's death bowling works. That sentence used to be speculative." |

## The Phil Steele Rule

Every section must teach the reader something they didn't know how to ask about yet. If a paragraph could appear in any generic cricket preview, it doesn't belong in Cricket Playbook.

This is not a suggestion. It is a hard requirement inherited from the Constitution (Section 1.3). Content that fails this test is rejected at editorial review.

---

## Enforcement Protocol

### Review Chain

1. **Virat Kohli** reviews all editorial content for tone compliance before publication.
2. **Tom Brady** enforces editorial consistency across all stat packs and outputs.
3. **Andy Flower** validates that tone choices do not distort cricket accuracy.

### Violation Handling

| Severity | Example | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Minor | Slightly forced pun, borderline alliteration | Flag and suggest revision |
| Moderate | Em dash usage, exclamation in body, internet-speak | Mandatory revision before publish |
| Major | Stacked metaphors, cliche-heavy section, tone drift | Section rewrite required |
