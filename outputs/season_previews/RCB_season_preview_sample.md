## The Headline

**RCB's Bowling-First Revolution Has Arrived — And It's Sustainable**

For a decade, Royal Challengers Bengaluru meant one thing: batting spectacle propped up by bowling fragility. That story ended in 2025. The franchise that once treated bowling as an afterthought posted a 73.3% win rate, reached the IPL Final, and did it behind a powerplay bowling attack that conceded over a run per over fewer than the league average. The question for 2026 is not whether RCB can bat — it is whether their bowling-first identity survives the pressure of expectations.

---

## The Story

The 2025 season was the most significant in RCB's modern history. Not because of the final they reached, but because of *how* they reached it. Josh Hazlewood (12.50 Cr, retained) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (10.75 Cr, retained) formed a powerplay bowling partnership that opponents could not decode — Hazlewood at 7.54 economy, Bhuvneshwar at 8.26 across their IPL careers since 2023. For context, RCB's team powerplay bowling economy dropped from 9.77 in 2024 to 8.73 in 2025, a transformation of over a run per over. RCB's opening pair with the ball was doing what their opening pair with the bat had always done: setting the terms of engagement.

The middle overs belonged to Krunal Pandya (5.75 Cr, retained). His 7.45 middle-overs economy across 82 overs gave RCB what they had never had before: a phase of controlled pressure. Opponents could not recover from Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar starts because Krunal refused to let them breathe.

The death overs revealed a different dimension: Tim David (3.00 Cr, retained) at 184.6 SR across 286 balls in death overs (MEDIUM sample), with Jitesh Sharma (11.00 Cr, retained) at 191.6 SR across 178 balls alongside him. The team that once needed Kohli to anchor now has designated death-overs firepower.

For 2026, the core returns intact. Rajat Patidar (11.00 Cr, retained) takes the captaincy from Faf du Plessis. Phil Salt (11.50 Cr, retained) provides the explosive top-order presence that Kohli's measured accumulation needs as a counterweight. The squad has been supplemented with six auction purchases, headlined by Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr) to shore up batting depth. The question marks are specific: Can Yash Dayal's off-field situation be resolved? Can the spin depth survive if opponents target the off-spin and wrist-spin gaps? And can the middle order shoulder more of the load?

---

## Off-Season Changes

**Captaincy:** Rajat Patidar takes over as captain, replacing Faf du Plessis. Patidar has never captained at this level, but his middle-order role (batting position 4) gives him a vantage point du Plessis lacked as an opening batter. The captaincy shift signals RCB's desire for a longer-term Indian leader.

**Key Departures:** Faf du Plessis, Cameron Green, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj, and Glenn Maxwell are no longer with the squad. The loss of Siraj removes a proven death-bowling option, while Maxwell's departure leaves a hole at the spin-hitting all-rounder slot. Ferguson's exit removes express pace depth.

**Key Retentions:** RCB retained 15 players, anchored by Kohli (21.00 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), Salt (11.50 Cr), and Patidar (11.00 Cr). The retention of Kanishk Chouhan (6.00 Cr) — a 19-year-old uncapped off-spin all-rounder — at a premium price signals a long-term investment in addressing the spin gap.

**Auction Strategy:** Six purchases totaling 10.65 Cr, with Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr) as the headline buy. The remaining buys (Shepherd, Duffy, Deswal, Mangesh Yadav, Jordan Cox) were all below 2 Cr, focused on pace depth and backup options. The franchise prioritized retaining its core over splashing at auction.

**What is Structurally Different from 2025:** The biggest change is squad composition philosophy. RCB has moved from having two premium overseas pace options (Hazlewood + Ferguson) to one (Hazlewood), freeing an overseas slot for batting (Salt, David, Bethell, or Shepherd). The bowling attack is now more reliant on Indian seamers (Bhuvneshwar, Yash Dayal, Mangesh Yadav) to complement Hazlewood.

---

## New Additions

**Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr, All-rounder, IND)** — The headline purchase. Iyer's 149.9 SR and 31.6 average across 34 innings since 2023 (HIGH sample) bring middle-order batting substance that RCB lacked. A left-hander who can bat at 3 or 4 and offers part-time seam, he fills the gap left by Maxwell and Cameron Green. His 162.9 SR against fast bowling (MEDIUM, 151 balls) suggests he can handle pace-heavy attacks. The concern: 96.9 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 32 balls) and 75.0 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 16 balls) — limited data, but a flag worth monitoring.

**Romario Shepherd (2.00 Cr, All-rounder, WI)** — A seam-bowling all-rounder with extraordinary hitting ability: 282.2 SR across 45 balls in IPL (LOW sample), including 127 runs at 288.6 SR in death overs (LOW, 44 balls). His bowling economy of 12.23 across 26 overs is expensive, but his role is clear: death-overs impact with bat and ball. He replaces the Cameron Green slot as a pace-bowling all-rounder option.

**Jacob Duffy (0.75 Cr, Bowler, NZ)** — Uncapped in IPL. A right-arm fast-medium option providing pace depth behind Hazlewood. Insurance for the overseas seamer slot if Hazlewood is rested or unavailable.

**Satvik Deswal (0.30 Cr, Bowler, IND)** — An 18-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner, addressing the most glaring depth chart gap. Uncapped in IPL, Deswal is a development pick that signals RCB's awareness of their wrist-spin deficit (depth chart rating: 1.3/10).

**Mangesh Yadav (0.30 Cr, Bowler, IND)** — Left-arm fast bowler who has shown promise in 6 IPL matches: 9 wickets at 9.32 economy. His 47.1% dot ball percentage in middle overs (LOW, 11 overs) is eye-catching. Provides left-arm pace variety that the squad otherwise lacks with Yash Dayal's status uncertain.

**Jordan Cox (0.30 Cr, Wicketkeeper, ENG)** — Backup wicketkeeper option behind Salt and Jitesh Sharma. Uncapped in IPL. A low-cost insurance pick.

## Team Style Analysis

RCB's identity has undergone a fundamental shift across the last two IPL seasons. What was once a bat-first franchise now builds its game plan around bowling control — and the data quantifies this evolution precisely.

**2024: The Transition Year**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 156.9 | 9.77 |
| Middle | 146.9 | 9.53 |
| Death | 195.9 | 10.90 |

In 2024, RCB were aggressive with the bat across all phases — a 195.9 death SR was among the league's highest. But their bowling was middle-of-the-pack, conceding 9.77 in the powerplay and 10.90 at the death. The team still relied on outscoring opponents rather than restricting them. The squad was constructed around batting star power (Kohli, du Plessis, Maxwell, Patidar) with bowling as a secondary concern.

**2025: The Revolution**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy | Delta from 2024 |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 154.1 | 8.73 | Bat: -2.8 / Bowl: -1.04 |
| Middle | 143.9 | 8.89 | Bat: -3.0 / Bowl: -0.64 |
| Death | 180.8 | 10.75 | Bat: -15.1 / Bowl: -0.15 |

The transformation is stark. Batting strike rates dropped across every phase — particularly at the death, where RCB went from 195.9 to 180.8. But bowling economy improved dramatically: powerplay economy dropped by over a run per over (9.77 to 8.73), and middle-overs economy fell from 9.53 to 8.89. RCB became a team that won by restricting opponents, not by chasing down totals through sheer aggression.

**Squad-Building Philosophy:** RCB has evolved from stacking batting talent to investing in bowling infrastructure. The retention of Bhuvneshwar (10.75 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), and Krunal (5.75 Cr) — three of the four most expensive bowler retentions — tells the story. They are top-heavy with the bat (Kohli + Salt carry the powerplay; David + Jitesh carry the death), lean in the middle order, and deep with bowling options. The all-rounder count (Venkatesh Iyer, Krunal, Shepherd, Bethell, Swapnil Singh) suggests a belief in flexibility over specialization. This is a franchise that has learned its lesson: you cannot buy your way to a title with batters alone.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Key Metric (2025) | Context |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Batting — Powerplay** | 6.5/10 | 154.1 SR | Slightly above average; dependent on Salt firing |
| **Batting — Middle** | 6.0/10 | 143.9 SR | League-average; this is the weakest phase |
| **Batting — Death** | 8.0/10 | 180.8 SR | Elite trio of David (184.6), Jitesh (191.6), Kohli (183.3) |
| **Bowling — Powerplay** | 8.5/10 | 8.73 econ | Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar axis is among the best in IPL |
| **Bowling — Middle** | 7.5/10 | 8.89 econ | Krunal's 7.45 econ anchors this phase |
| **Bowling — Death** | 5.5/10 | 10.75 econ | Yash Dayal's status creates uncertainty; Bhuvneshwar at 10.96 econ is below par |
| **Overall** | **7.0/10** | | Strong bowling core + death batting offset by middle-overs batting and death bowling gaps |

The ratings reveal a team with clearly defined peaks and valleys. Powerplay bowling and death batting are elite-tier strengths. Middle-overs batting and death bowling are structural vulnerabilities. The overall 7.0 reflects a squad that is very good at what it does well, but has limited capacity to compensate when its strengths are neutralized.

## Venue Analysis: M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru

The Chinnaswamy is one of IPL's most distinctive venues, and the data since 2023 (19 matches in the since-2023 window) reveals a ground that amplifies both batting aggression and bowling skill.

**Chinnaswamy Phase Profile (Since 2023, aggregated across innings)**

| Phase | Run Rate | Boundary % | Dot Ball % | Wkts/Match |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 23.6% | 42.3% | 1.6 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 18.6% | 28.4% | 2.5 |
| Death | 11.25 | 24.4% | 28.7% | 2.4 |

**vs. League Averages (All Venues)**

| Phase | Chinnaswamy RR | League RR | Delta |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 9.26 | -0.17 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 8.76 | +0.53 |
| Death | 11.25 | 10.87 | +0.38 |

The Chinnaswamy plays slightly slower than average in the powerplay but significantly faster in the middle and death overs. Middle-overs run rate is 0.53 runs per over above the league average — a meaningful deviation that explains why spin control is so valuable here. Death-overs run rate (11.25) is 0.38 above average, rewarding teams with death-hitting capability.

**How RCB's Strengths Interact with the Venue:**
- RCB's powerplay bowling (8.73 economy in 2025) should thrive in a venue where the powerplay is not as batting-friendly as reputation suggests
- The elevated middle-overs run rate makes Krunal Pandya's 7.45 economy even more valuable — he is effectively bowling 1.84 runs per over below the venue average in that phase
- Death batting (David, Jitesh, Kohli) is perfectly suited to the Chinnaswamy's high death-overs run rate
- The key risk: if opponents can target RCB's thin spin depth in the middle overs, the venue's elevated scoring rate in that phase will amplify the damage

## Schedule Analysis

**Status: IPL 2026 schedule has not been released.**

When the schedule is available, this section will analyze:
- **Home/away split:** Number of Chinnaswamy matches vs. away games, and implications for squad selection (seam-heavy at home, spin options away)
- **Cluster analysis:** Sequences of tough opponents, back-to-back games, and whether RCB faces top-4 contenders in bunches or spread across the season
- **Rest days:** Time between matches, particularly relevant for Bhuvneshwar Kumar's workload management at age 36 and Hazlewood's availability windows
- **Travel burden:** Distance between consecutive venues and impact on recovery
- **Early vs. late difficulty:** Whether RCB's tougher fixtures fall before or after the squad has settled its best XII

## Players to Watch

### Phil Salt — The Powerplay Detonator
177.5 career strike rate across 595 balls (HIGH sample). Salt is not just quick — he is the most destructive opener in IPL who does not get the credit because he plays alongside Kohli. In 2026, Salt's role is existential: RCB's team powerplay SR of 154.1 needs a gear-shift, and Salt is the only player in this squad who can single-handedly provide it. Against fast-medium bowling, he strikes at 179.7 across 207 balls (HIGH). Against left-arm orthodox, he maintains 180.4 across 56 balls (MEDIUM). The one flag: 123.6 SR against leg-spin across 55 balls (MEDIUM) — teams with quality leg-spinners have a route to neutralize him.

### Rajat Patidar — The Captain's Burden
Patidar's numbers tell two stories. Against leg-spin, he is devastating: 225.0 SR across 72 balls (MEDIUM), devouring slow bowlers. Against fast bowling, he is more mortal: 129.1 SR across 110 balls (MEDIUM). But he has never captained at this level, and he is taking over a team with momentum. His recent form is a concern: 120.8 SR in his last 10 innings, down 33.7 points from his 154.5 career SR. If Patidar can recapture even his average form, RCB's middle order strengthens considerably. If the captaincy weighs on his batting, the number 4 slot becomes a vulnerability.

### Bhuvneshwar Kumar — The Load-Bearing Wall
At 36, Bhuvneshwar should not still be this effective. His 8.26 powerplay economy across 99 overs (HIGH) and 47.5% dot ball percentage in the powerplay are elite numbers. He is RCB's only bowler who can reliably open an innings. But his death bowling — 10.96 economy across 48 overs (MEDIUM) — shows the cost of age. His 22.2% dot ball rate at the death is among the lowest for frontline seamers. If he breaks down, there is no like-for-like replacement in this squad. Bhuvneshwar's fitness is, quietly, the single most important variable in RCB's season.

### Krunal Pandya — The Invisible Anchor
Krunal's numbers do not make highlights, but they make wins. His 7.45 economy in the middle overs across 82 overs (MEDIUM) is elite, and his 30.3% dot ball rate in that phase creates the pressure that sets up death-overs dominance. His 25 middle-overs wickets are the most for any RCB bowler in that phase. What makes Krunal irreplaceable is what he does not concede: 12.0% boundary rate in the middle, compared to a league average well above 17%. He is the reason RCB's bowling-first identity works — and he has no backup in this squad.

---

## Players Who Need to Step Up

**1. Devdutt Padikkal — Filling the Middle-Overs Batting Gap**
RCB's middle-overs batting (143.9 SR in 2025) is their weakest offensive phase. Padikkal (2.00 Cr, retained), currently on the bench, has the tools to address this: he is a left-hander who can bat at 3 or 4, and his 186.9 SR against fast bowling (MEDIUM, 99 balls) shows genuine stroke-play ability. The problem: 131.6 career SR and a recent form SR of 151.5 (last 10) that still sits below most starters. If Padikkal can sustain his upswing and push for the XI, he gives RCB a middle-order option they currently lack. His 108.8 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 34 balls) and 62.5 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 8 balls) are developmental flags, but the upside is meaningful.

**2. Kanishk Chouhan — Addressing the Off-Spin Void**
RCB's off-spin depth chart is rated 1.4/10. Chouhan (6.00 Cr, retained) is a 19-year-old uncapped off-spin all-rounder who was retained at a premium precisely because of this gap. He has zero IPL data, which makes projection uncertain, but RCB paid 6 Cr for a reason: they need a bowling option against left-handers in the middle overs, and Chouhan is the only player in the squad who can provide it. If he can deliver even 2-3 overs per match at a sub-9 economy, it transforms RCB's spin options.

**3. Suyash Sharma — Death Bowling Development**
Suyash (2.60 Cr, retained) has been a middle-overs specialist (8.78 economy, 13 wickets in 78 overs, MEDIUM), but his death bowling economy of 10.67 across 12 overs (LOW) is expensive. With Yash Dayal's status uncertain and Bhuvneshwar's death bowling below par (10.96 economy), RCB need Suyash to develop as a death-overs option. His 3 powerplay wickets at 7.33 economy (LOW, 3 overs) suggest versatility — but the death remains his growth frontier.

## Recent Form

### Batters (IPL Recent Form)

| Player | Last 10 Inn | L10 Runs | L10 SR | Career SR | SR Delta | Trend |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Virat Kohli | 10 | 471 | 144.5 | 133.2 | +11.3 | Ascending |
| Phil Salt | 10 | 301 | 180.2 | 177.5 | +2.8 | Stable-elite |
| Jitesh Sharma | 10 | 249 | 176.6 | 157.8 | +18.8 | Career-best form |
| Tim David | 10 | 187 | 183.3 | 174.8 | +8.5 | Above career |
| Venkatesh Iyer | 10 | 287 | 162.2 | 137.5 | +24.7 | Significant uptick |
| Romario Shepherd | 10 | 153 | 259.3 | 217.7 | +41.7 | Explosive (small sample) |
| Devdutt Padikkal | 10 | 247 | 151.5 | 126.7 | +24.8 | Rebounding |
| Rajat Patidar | 10 | 151 | 120.8 | 154.5 | -33.7 | Concerning decline |
| Krunal Pandya | 10 | 163 | 124.4 | 132.6 | -8.2 | Slight dip |

**Key Takeaway:** The squad is largely in strong form. Kohli's recent 144.5 SR (last 10) is well above his 133.2 career mark, suggesting the 37-year-old is playing with more intent. Venkatesh Iyer's +24.7 SR delta makes him an especially timely acquisition. The red flag is Patidar: a -33.7 SR delta in his last 10 innings is the largest negative swing in the squad. For a new captain, this is a trend that needs reversing.

### Bowlers (Phase Economy Trends, 2024 vs 2025)

| Player | Phase | 2025 Team Econ | Role |
|--------|-------|---------------|------|
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | Powerplay | 8.73 (team) | Primary new-ball |
| Josh Hazlewood | Powerplay | 8.73 (team) | Primary new-ball |
| Krunal Pandya | Middle | 8.89 (team) | Primary middle-overs |
| Yash Dayal | Death | 10.75 (team) | Primary death (status uncertain) |
| Suyash Sharma | Middle | 8.89 (team) | Secondary middle-overs |

RCB's bowling unit improved across every phase from 2024 to 2025. The most dramatic improvement was in powerplay bowling (9.77 to 8.73), driven by the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar partnership. The death remains the weakest bowling phase at 10.75, though this was still an improvement from 2024's 10.90.

## Interesting Data Insights

**1. Kohli's Death-Overs SR Is Real — But Context Matters**
Virat Kohli's 183.3 SR at the death across 114 balls (MEDIUM, 15 innings) ranks among the best in the squad. But Kohli entered in the powerplay in all 44 of his innings since 2023 — every single time. He never walked in at the death as a designated finisher. His death-overs numbers come exclusively from batting through the innings, meaning he only reaches overs 16-20 in 15 of 44 innings (34%). When Kohli does bat at the death, he does so having already built a platform and with the confidence of set batting. This is a fundamentally different context than a Tim David who enters specifically to hit from ball one. Both are valuable; they are not the same skill.

**2. Patidar's Leg-Spin Destruction Is Elite**
Rajat Patidar strikes at 225.0 against leg-spin across 72 balls (MEDIUM) — the highest SR against any bowling type for any RCB batter with a meaningful sample. He has been dismissed just 3 times in those 72 balls, averaging 54.0. This is not accidental: Patidar's wrist-spin destruction (while the sample is smaller at 32 balls) drops to 112.5, suggesting he reads leg-spin specifically — not wrist-spin generically — with unusual clarity. For opposition captains: do not bowl your leg-spinner to Patidar.

**3. Jitesh Sharma's Career-Best Form Is Hiding in the Death**
Jitesh's recent form SR of 176.6 (last 10 innings) is 18.8 points above his career mark, but the real story is in the phase breakdown. His 191.6 death SR across 178 balls (MEDIUM) is the highest among designated finishers in the RCB squad — above Tim David (184.6) and Kohli (183.3). At 11.00 Cr, Jitesh was an expensive retention, but if his death-overs trend continues, he justifies the price as a finisher who can also keep wicket.

**4. Hazlewood's Dot Ball Rate Is Historically Unusual**
Josh Hazlewood's 54.2% dot ball percentage in the powerplay (28 overs, MEDIUM) is extraordinary. More than half of all deliveries he bowls in the powerplay yield zero runs. For context, the team's overall powerplay dot ball rate is around 40-43%. Hazlewood is not just economical — he is a pressure machine, building dot-ball sequences that force batters into errors. His 12 powerplay wickets in just 15 matches since 2023 are a direct result.

**5. RCB's Left-Arm Pace Dependency Is a Hidden Structural Risk**
Yash Dayal is the only left-arm pacer in the predicted XII, and his status is uncertain due to off-field issues. Mangesh Yadav (left-arm fast, 6 matches) is the only backup, but his 12.33 powerplay economy (LOW, 6 overs) suggests he is not yet ready for that role. If Dayal is unavailable, RCB loses all left-arm pace variation — something opponents can exploit by stacking right-handed batters without fear of angle changes.

---

## The Bold Take

**Virat Kohli is no longer RCB's most important player — Bhuvneshwar Kumar is.**

The data is unambiguous. Kohli's 2,037 runs at 146.6 SR are extraordinary, but his powerplay SR (151.9) and middle-overs SR (134.2) are not pace-setting numbers. His elite contribution comes at the death (183.3 SR), but as established above, this is a consequence of batting through — not a designated role. More importantly: remove Kohli, and RCB's batting has options (Salt, Patidar, Venkatesh Iyer, David, Padikkal). Remove Bhuvneshwar, and the bowling-first identity — the very thing that drove 73.3% win rate in 2025 — ceases to exist. There is no backup swing bowler. There is no second powerplay specialist who can match his 8.26 economy. At 36, Bhuvneshwar Kumar is not RCB's sentimental veteran — he is the load-bearing wall. His 47.5% powerplay dot ball rate is not replaceable by anyone in this squad.

## By the Numbers

| Stat | Value | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| **8.73** | RCB's 2025 powerplay bowling economy | Down from 9.77 in 2024 — a run-per-over improvement that transformed the franchise |
| **183.3** | Kohli's death SR (114 balls, MEDIUM) | Comes from batting through in 15/44 innings, not as a designated finisher |
| **-33.7** | Patidar's SR delta (last 10 vs career) | New captain's batting form is the squad's most concerning trend |
| **7.45** | Krunal's middle-overs economy (82 overs, MEDIUM) | 1.44 runs per over below the league average — the invisible pillar of RCB's bowling plan |
| **1.4 / 10** | Off-spin depth chart rating | No frontline off-spinner in squad; Kanishk Chouhan (uncapped) is the only option |

## Keys to Victory

**1. Bhuvneshwar Must Stay Fit for 14+ Matches**
RCB's bowling identity is built on the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar powerplay partnership. Hazlewood, as an overseas player, may have availability windows. Bhuvneshwar, at 36, has managed workload concerns in recent seasons. If he misses more than 3-4 matches, RCB's powerplay bowling economy could revert toward the 9.77 it was in 2024. The franchise has no like-for-like replacement: Mangesh Yadav and Yash Dayal are not swing bowlers. This is the single biggest structural risk in the squad.

**2. The Middle Order Must Contribute Beyond 42-43% of Runs**
In 2025, RCB's top 3 (Kohli, Salt, du Plessis) contributed roughly 57.7% of runs. With du Plessis gone and Venkatesh Iyer slotting in at 3, the middle order (Patidar at 4, David at 5, Jitesh at 6) needs to shoulder a larger share. Specifically, Patidar's -33.7 SR delta must reverse. If the middle order can push toward 50-55% of the run contribution, it reduces the collapse risk that eliminated RCB in the 2025 final.

**3. The Off-Spin Gap Cannot Be Left Unaddressed**
The 1.4/10 off-spin depth rating is not a quirk — it is a structural vulnerability. Without a frontline off-spinner, RCB cannot create match-up advantages against left-handed batters in the middle overs. Kanishk Chouhan (6.00 Cr, uncapped) is the investment thesis, but he has zero IPL data. If Chouhan fails to deliver, opponents with left-hand-heavy middle orders (think KKR, SRH) will target this gap relentlessly. Krunal Pandya's left-arm orthodox is not a replacement for genuine off-spin.

**4. Overseas Slot Management Must Be Decisive**
RCB has 7 overseas players: Salt, Hazlewood, David, Shepherd, Bethell, Duffy, and Cox. Only 4 can play. Salt (keeper-opener) and Hazlewood (lead seamer) are locks. David (death finisher) is near-certain. The fourth slot is a genuine selection puzzle: Shepherd (pace AR), Bethell (batting AR with LA spin), or Duffy (pace depth). Getting this selection right — and being willing to rotate based on opposition — separates a good squad from a title-contending one. The risk: sentimentality or rigidity in a slot that demands tactical flexibility.

## Andy Flower's Scouting Report

**Tactical Identity:** Bowling-first, death-finishing. RCB's game plan is to strangle opponents through overs 1-15 (Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar-Krunal axis) and then unleash batting firepower in overs 16-20.

**Structural Strengths:**
- Powerplay bowling (Hazlewood at 7.54 PP economy + Bhuvneshwar at 8.26 PP economy) is among the best two-bowler combinations in IPL
- Middle-overs spin control (Krunal at 7.45 economy across 82 overs) is elite
- Death-overs batting depth (David 184.6 SR / 286 balls, Jitesh 191.6 SR / 178 balls, Kohli 183.3 SR / 114 balls) gives three separate threats
- Chinnaswamy's slightly below-average powerplay scoring rate suits the bowling attack's strength

**Structural Vulnerabilities:**
- Off-spin and left-arm wrist-spin are effectively absent from this squad (1.4 and 1.3/10 depth ratings)
- Powerplay batting is not a major strength — Salt must carry this phase
- Top 3 dependency (57.7% of runs in 2025) creates knockout-stage collapse risk
- Yash Dayal's off-field status creates left-arm pace depth uncertainty
- Bhuvneshwar's workload management at 36 is a season-long tightrope
- Death bowling economy (10.75 in 2025) remains the weakest bowling phase

**Opposition Blueprint:** Bowl off-spin and wrist-spin in the middle overs — RCB has no counter. Target Padikkal (62.5 SR vs wrist-spin, LOW sample but directional) and David (33.3 SR vs wrist-spin, LOW / 9 balls) if they play. Force Kohli into the middle overs where he strikes at 134.2 SR — materially below his powerplay (151.9) and death (183.3) rates. Avoid the powerplay bowling duel with Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar at all costs. If chasing, do not let the game reach overs 16-20 with RCB needing less than 50 — their death batting is too deep.

**Matchup Targets:** Kohli's weakest bowling type matchup is right-arm off-spin at 101.9 SR (53 balls, MEDIUM) — this is exploitable with a quality off-spinner. Tim David's wrist-spin vulnerability (33.3 SR, 9 balls) is a small sample but worth testing. Patidar's recent form slump (-33.7 SR delta) suggests he may be susceptible to early pressure if the new-ball bowlers can create doubt.

## Verdict

RCB in 2026 is a team that knows what it is — and that self-knowledge is worth more than any auction buy. The bowling-first identity that drove 73.3% win rate in 2025 returns with its core intact, augmented by Venkatesh Iyer's batting depth and Shepherd's death-overs impact. If Bhuvneshwar stays fit, Patidar's form recovers, and the off-spin gap does not prove fatal, this is a top-4 squad with a genuine shot at the franchise's first title. If any of those three pillars wobble, the old RCB — brilliant but brittle — is waiting just beneath the surface.

**Projected Finish: 3rd-4th** | **Ceiling: Champions** | **Floor: 6th**
