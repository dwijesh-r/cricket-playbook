Sends schema context + user question to Claude API client-side to generate SQL. Runs generated SQL in DuckDB-WASM. Displays results in a styled widget. Andy Flower insight panel: sends query results back to Claude with Andy Flower persona prompt to generate cricket context and insights. Graceful fallback if no API key — redirects user to Example Queries. Depends on TKT-B, TKT-C, and TKT-E.",
