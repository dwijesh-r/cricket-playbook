## Pricing Philosophy

> "Cricket fans don't pay for analytics, they pay for confidence, narrative clarity and authority."

### What They're Actually Buying

| Surface | Underlying |
|---------|------------|
| Team stat pack | Permission to have an opinion |
| Predicted XI | Fantasy league edge |
| Depth charts | Insider knowledge feeling |
| Matchup data | Conversation ammunition |

### Price Anchors

- A coffee before the match: Rs 300
- A sports magazine: Rs 200-500
- Fantasy league entry: Rs 50-500
- **Our stat pack:** Should feel like a small investment for big confidence

## Editorial Principles

### 1. Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
We commit to clear stances. Not "Player X could do well if conditions favor him" but "Player X is your PP match-winner against this bowling attack."

### 2. Data-Backed, Not Data-Driven
We use data to support editorial judgment, not replace it. Andy Flower's cricket intuition + Stephen Curry's numbers = authoritative insight.

### 3. Ruthless Compression
Remove every word that doesn't add value. Fans are busy. Respect their time.

### 4. Ahead of the Curve
We tell fans what to watch for BEFORE it happens. Not "Kohli scored 80" but "Watch how Kohli targets spinners in the middle overs."

### 5. No Hedging
Avoid: "It depends," "Could go either way," "Time will tell."
Prefer: "This is why X will dominate," "Here's the vulnerability to exploit."

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Predicted XI
No one else offers algorithm-based XI predictions with explanations. Fantasy players need this.

### 2. Depth Charts
Position-by-position rankings like NFL teams use. Shows we think like professionals.

### 3. Phase Analysis
Not just "good batter" but "PP dominator, middle-overs liability, death-overs finisher." Granular.

### 4. Matchup Intelligence
Not just career stats but "X vs Y in death overs at this venue." Specific.

## Brand Voice

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Sound like a confident analyst | Sound like Wikipedia |
| Use cricket vernacular | Over-explain basics |
| Make bold predictions | Hedge every statement |
| Reference specific situations | Speak in generalities |
| Acknowledge uncertainty briefly | Obsess over caveats |

**Example Transformation:**

Before (Academic):
> "Bumrah has a career economy rate of 7.41 in IPL matches. His performance varies based on match phase, with better numbers in powerplay and death overs compared to middle overs."

After (Editorial):
> "Bumrah is your death-overs insurance. Deploy him overs 17-20 and watch batters panic. His middle-overs are exploitable - that's when to attack."

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Repeat buyers | >60% | Value proven |
| Social shares | 5+ per pack | Word of mouth |
| Fantasy league mentions | Tracked | Use case validated |
| "I didn't know that" reactions | Qualitative | Insight quality |

---

## The Ultimate Test

**Would a professional cricket analyst read this and nod?**
- If yes: We're on track
- If no: We're too superficial

**Would a casual fan read this and feel smarter?**
- If yes: We're accessible
- If no: We're too academic

Both must be yes.
