## The Headline

**Dhoni's Final Chapter and the Post-Dynasty Transition.**

Five titles, three finals, and the most successful franchise in IPL history. But the 2025 season wasn't a stumble; it was a fall. A 28.6% win rate, the worst in CSK's history, a powerplay batting SR that dropped to 137.2, and a bowling attack that leaked 9.58 in the powerplay after years of disciplined control. Now comes the hardest question any dynasty faces: how do you rebuild a team around a 43-year-old icon whose role is no longer what it was, while integrating a new wicketkeeper-batter in Sanju Samson and trusting a bowling attack anchored by a 20-year-old Afghan left-arm wrist spinner?

---

## The Story

The 2025 season was the reckoning CSK had been deferring for three years. A squad that won the title in 2023 on the back of Conway-Gaikwad partnerships and Jadeja-Pathirana bowling spells couldn't mask its age any longer. Four wins in 14 matches. A run rate that declined across every phase. And the unmistakable sense that the dynasty had finally exhausted its accumulated capital.

The numbers tell the story in three phases. Powerplay batting SR fell from 148.3 in 2023 to 137.2 in 2025, with wickets lost per innings climbing from 0.6 to 2.1. The middle overs, once anchored by Jadeja's batting and Deshpande's bowling, regressed to 131.1 SR (batting) and 8.74 economy (bowling). Only the death overs retained any semblance of competitiveness, but even there, the batting SR dropped from 180.4 in 2024 to 155.8 in 2025.

The off-season response was radical. Ravindra Jadeja, the franchise's most complete cricketer for the better part of a decade, is gone. So are Devon Conway, Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande, and Daryl Mitchell. The replacement strategy involved two headline moves: trading for Sanju Samson (18.00 Cr) from Rajasthan Royals and retaining Noor Ahmad (10.00 Cr), the Afghan wrist spinner who took 24 wickets in 2025 at 7.95 economy. Around them, CSK invested heavily in an uncapped Indian talent in Prashant Veer (14.20 Cr at auction) and Kartik Sharma (14.20 Cr), two gambles that suggest the franchise is betting on the future even as it honours the past.

The central question for 2026 is whether CSK can function as a transitional franchise. MS Dhoni (4.00 Cr, retained) is 43 years old. His 2025 SR of 127.3 was a 69-point drop from 196.3 in 2024. His death-overs career SR of 176.5 remains elite across 197 innings (HIGH), but the last 10 innings (129.3 SR) suggest the clock is ticking audibly. Samson's arrival gives CSK a genuine replacement behind the stumps, a batter who strikes at 151.0 across 780 balls since 2023 (HIGH) and offers 191.7 SR at the death (48 innings, MEDIUM). But Samson has never worn yellow before, and the weight of replacing Dhoni in Chennai carries a pressure that transcends cricket.

If the bowling holds through Noor Ahmad's middle-overs brilliance and Khaleel Ahmed's new-ball aggression, and if the batting depth from Gaikwad, Samson, Dube, and Brevis can offset the structural losses, CSK have a plausible path to the playoffs. If the transition stumbles, the dynasty's final chapter could be shorter than anyone in Chennai wants to imagine.

---

## Off-Season Changes

**Captaincy:** Ruturaj Gaikwad (18.00 Cr, retained) continues as captain after taking charge from Dhoni in 2024. His 2025 SR improved to 148.8 from 137.2, even as the team around him collapsed. Gaikwad's challenge in 2026 is managing not just a cricket team but a franchise in generational transition with all the expectation that entails.

**Key Departures (from 2025 squad):** Ravindra Jadeja (to GT), Devon Conway (to DC), Matheesha Pathirana (to SRH), Tushar Deshpande (released), Daryl Mitchell (to PBKS), Rachin Ravindra (to MI). The scale of departure is staggering. Jadeja was CSK's all-phase utility player: 301 runs at 131.4 SR and 20 wickets at 7.45 economy across the 2023 season alone. Pathirana was the death-overs enforcer. Conway was the powerplay anchor. Losing all three in a single window is the cricketing equivalent of a front office fire sale.

**Key Retentions:** CSK retained 11 players: Gaikwad (18.00 Cr), Shivam Dube (12.00 Cr), Noor Ahmad (10.00 Cr), Khaleel Ahmed (4.80 Cr), MS Dhoni (4.00 Cr), Anshul Kamboj (3.40 Cr), Dewald Brevis (2.20 Cr), Gurjapneet Singh (2.20 Cr), Nathan Ellis (2.00 Cr), Jamie Overton (1.50 Cr), and Ayush Mhatre (0.30 Cr). The retention strategy reveals a clear priority: keep the bowling core intact (Noor Ahmad, Khaleel, Ellis, Kamboj, Overton) while trusting Dube and Gaikwad as the batting spine.

**What's Structurally Different from 2025:** Two fundamental shifts. First, spin-and-pace balance: Pathirana's pace has been replaced by Ellis and Overton, while Noor Ahmad's role expands as the primary wicket-taking threat. Second, the batting order: Samson replaces Conway as the opening wicketkeeper-batter, Brevis slots into the middle order as an overseas finisher, and the reliance on the top 3 has decreased from 64.5% of runs in 2023 to 43.4% in 2025. The squad is deeper but less experienced than any CSK team in memory.

## Auction Strategy: The Thinking Behind the Buys

CSK's auction was a study in calculated aggression. The headline buys were Prashant Veer (14.20 Cr, uncapped left-arm orthodox all-rounder) and Kartik Sharma (14.20 Cr, uncapped wicketkeeper), two massive gambles on domestic talent. The trade for Sanju Samson (18.00 Cr) from Rajasthan Royals was the transformational move.

### Direct XII Impact

**Sanju Samson (18.00 Cr, traded)** changes everything. He replaces Conway at the top and Dhoni behind the stumps in the long-term succession plan. His 151.0 SR across 780 balls since 2023 (HIGH) gives CSK a genuine power option at the top. His 181.7 SR against leg-spin (93 balls, MEDIUM) and 165.6 against fast-medium bowling (189 balls, MEDIUM) provide elite matchup flexibility. The concern: 115.1 SR against left-arm orthodox (86 balls, MEDIUM) and 109.4 SR against CSK's own opposition in previous years (93 balls vs CSK, MEDIUM). He needs to prove he can thrive in a different franchise culture.

**Prashant Veer (14.20 Cr)** is the single biggest auction gamble in the entire IPL 2026 cycle. An uncapped left-arm orthodox all-rounder with essentially zero IPL bowling data (0 overs) and zero IPL batting data. His SMAT economy of 2.3 (18 balls, LOW) is the only cross-tournament data point available. At 14.20 Cr, CSK are paying for potential, not production. The Founder has him in the predicted XII at #6, suggesting the franchise sees a genuine all-round talent. The risk is enormous.

### Depth Buys

| Buy | Price | Role in Squad | XII Impact vs Depth |
|-----|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Rahul Chahar (IND) | 1.80 Cr | Middle-overs leg-spin backup behind Noor Ahmad | **Rotation XII** -- 7.8 middle-overs econ across 239 overs (HIGH) |
| Matt Henry (NZ) | 1.20 Cr | Overseas pace backup behind Ellis | **Pure depth** -- 8.0 cross-tournament econ, 1 IPL wicket |
| Matthew Short (AUS) | 1.00 Cr | Overseas batting AR with part-time off-spin | **Bench depth** -- 127.2 IPL SR (92 balls, LOW) but 6.25 econ (4 overs, LOW) |
| Sarfaraz Khan (IND) | 0.50 Cr | Middle-order batting insurance | **Pure depth** -- 86.9 IPL SR (61 balls, LOW) |
| Akeal Hosein (WI) | 0.40 Cr | Left-arm orthodox spin depth | **Depth** -- 7.0 cross-tournament econ (3904 T20 balls, HIGH trust) |
| Zak Foulkes (AUS) | 0.40 Cr | Fast bowling AR depth | **Development** -- 8.1 T20 econ (59 matches, HIGH confidence) |

**What the Auction Tells You:** CSK are building two teams simultaneously. One is the 2026 XI -- Samson, Gaikwad, Dube, Brevis, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel -- designed to compete now. The other is the 2027+ squad -- Prashant Veer, Kartik Sharma, Ayush Mhatre, Gurjapneet Singh -- designed to thrive after the transition is complete. It's a franchise that has always thought in cycles, not seasons. This auction is the beginning of the next cycle.

## Team Style Analysis

CSK's identity has been in free fall. The three-season trajectory tells a story of a franchise losing its grip on the formula that made it the most consistent team in IPL history.

**2023: The Last Hurrah**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 148.3 | 8.77 |
| Middle | 143.0 | 7.65 |
| Death | 165.2 | 10.15 |

In 2023, CSK won the title with a balanced attack. The 7.65 middle-overs bowling economy was elite, driven by Jadeja (7.45 econ) and Pathirana. The batting was top-heavy (64.5% of runs from the top 3) but functional. The death bowling at 10.15 was solid. Everything worked because the individual parts were at their peak.

**2024: The Cracks Appear**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy | Delta from 2023 |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 138.5 | 8.76 | Bat: -9.8 / Bowl: -0.01 |
| Middle | 133.2 | 7.99 | Bat: -9.8 / Bowl: +0.34 |
| Death | 180.4 | 10.59 | Bat: +15.2 / Bowl: +0.44 |

The powerplay batting collapse began here. A near-10 point drop in SR. The death batting surged to 180.4 (Dhoni at 196.3 SR), masking the deterioration elsewhere. The bowling held, barely.

**2025: The Reckoning**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy | Delta from 2024 |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 137.2 | 9.58 | Bat: -1.3 / Bowl: +0.82 |
| Middle | 131.1 | 8.74 | Bat: -2.1 / Bowl: +0.75 |
| Death | 155.8 | 10.92 | Bat: -24.6 / Bowl: +0.33 |

Every number got worse. Powerplay bowling economy spiked to 9.58 (from 8.77 two years earlier). Death batting SR cratered from 180.4 to 155.8, a 24.6-point drop. Middle-overs bowling went from 7.65 to 8.74. Only Noor Ahmad (24 wickets at 7.95 economy) provided genuine quality.

**Squad-Building Philosophy:** CSK have gone from a team built on experienced Indian all-rounders (Jadeja, Bravo, Pathirana) to one betting on youth and overseas gambles. Nine all-rounders in the 25-player squad suggest a belief in flexibility, but five of them (Prashant Veer, Aman Khan, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Zak Foulkes) have minimal or zero IPL data. The philosophy is clear: rebuild with controllable investments while Dhoni's presence provides institutional stability during the transition. It's a bet that the culture can sustain a rebuild. CSK's history says it can. The 2025 record says the jury is still out.

## Category Ratings

### Phase Performance

| Category | Rating | Key Metric (2025) | Context |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Batting, Powerplay** | 4.5/10 | 137.2 SR | Below league average (146.3). Wickets lost per innings (2.1) is alarming |
| **Batting, Middle** | 5.0/10 | 131.1 SR | Below league (140.3). Dube and Gaikwad carry the load alone |
| **Batting, Death** | 6.0/10 | 155.8 SR | Below league (170.2). Dhoni's decline (127.3 SR in 2025) drags this down |
| **Bowling, Powerplay** | 5.0/10 | 9.58 econ | Above league (9.27). Loss of Pathirana and Deshpande is the cause |
| **Bowling, Middle** | 7.0/10 | 8.74 econ | Near league (8.77). Noor Ahmad at 7.90 econ (102 overs, HIGH) is the anchor |
| **Bowling, Death** | 5.0/10 | 10.92 econ | At league average (10.88). Khaleel at 11.58 death econ (31 overs, HIGH) is a liability |

### Squad Structure

| Category | Rating | Key Metric | Context |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Squad Depth** | 5.0/10 | 25 players, ~4 viable bench options | Off-spin depth 2.4/10. Three players above 14 Cr have zero IPL data. Bench is thin on proven talent |
| **XII Completeness** | 6.0/10 | 5 of 7 key roles filled | PP opening, middle order, death finisher, middle-overs spin all covered. Missing: frontline off-spinner, proven death specialist, second new-ball partner for Khaleel |
| **Batting Variety** | 6.5/10 | 2 LHB in top 6 (Dube, Prashant Veer) | Samson excels vs spin (168 SR); Gaikwad vs pace (150 SR). Balanced handedness in top 6 |
| **Bowling Variety** | 5.5/10 | 4 bowling types in XII | Left-arm wrist-spin (Noor Ahmad, 8.3/10 depth), left-arm pace (Khaleel, 4.0/10 depth), right-arm pace (5.7/10). Off-spin (2.4/10) and left-arm orthodox (2.5/10) are genuine gaps |
| **Experience** | 6.0/10 | 4 of XII have 30+ IPL caps | Dhoni (240+), Gaikwad (80+), Dube (70+), Samson (160+) provide tournament pedigree. But Prashant Veer (0), Mhatre (7), Overton (3) bring virtually none |

### Overall

| Category | Rating | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Overall** | **5.8/10** | Phase performance (avg 5.4) slightly offset by structural depth where Samson and Noor Ahmad carry disproportionate weight. The gap between the peaks (middle-overs bowling 7.0) and valleys (powerplay batting 4.5) is the widest in the franchise's history. A team in transition, not yet a team in contention. |

## Team Batting Profile: How CSK Handle Different Bowling

### vs. Bowling Types (Since 2023, aggregated from squad members)

| Bowling Type | CSK Batter SR | League Avg SR | Diff | Verdict |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------|---------|
| Fast-Medium | 165.6 (Samson), 167.1 (Dube) | 144.9 | +20.7 (Samson) | Dominant. Samson and Dube punish medium pace |
| Fast | 136.9 (Gaikwad), 198.8 (Dhoni) | 144.9 | Variable | Dhoni elite, Gaikwad below par |
| Leg-spin | 181.7 (Samson), 166.3 (Dube) | 141.1 | +40.6 (Samson) | Samson is a leg-spin destroyer |
| Left-arm orthodox | 170.97 (Gaikwad), 115.1 (Samson) | 138.3 | Gaikwad +32.7, Samson -23.2 | Split personality |
| Off-spin | 125.0 (Gaikwad), 117.98 (Dube) | 132.3 | -7.3 (Gaikwad) | Below average. The shared vulnerability |
| Wrist-spin | 166.7 (Gaikwad), 134.6 (Samson) | 124.7 | Gaikwad +42.0 | Gaikwad excels; Samson average |

The batting profile reveals CSK's squad is built around pace exploitation and spin dominance from specific individuals. Samson's 181.7 SR against leg-spin (93 balls, MEDIUM) is the standout number in the entire squad. Dube at 166.3 SR against leg-spin (92 balls, MEDIUM) makes this a team that actively welcomes the leggie. Where CSK struggle is against off-spin: Gaikwad at 125.0 (40 balls, LOW), Dube at 117.98 (89 balls, MEDIUM). It's a meaningful sample for Dube, and 18 points below the league average. Opposition captains take note: off-spin is the weapon.

### Phase-Wise Batting (Since 2023)

| Phase | CSK SR | League SR | Diff | Boundary % (CSK) | Dot % (CSK / League) |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Powerplay | 141.5 | 146.3 | -4.8 | 22.3% | 40.9% / 44.1% |
| Middle | 135.3 | 140.3 | -5.0 | 15.0% | 29.3% / 30.6% |
| Death | 166.2 | 170.2 | -4.0 | 21.7% | 28.8% / 30.3% |

CSK sit below the league average across all three phases. The powerplay deficit (-4.8 SR) reflects the loss of Conway's stability and the transition to Samson-Mhatre. The middle overs (-5.0) are the weakest link, where only Gaikwad at 142.5 SR (732 balls, HIGH) performs above the team average. The death overs (-4.0) are dragged down by Dhoni's 2025 decline, though Samson's 191.7 death SR (407 balls, MEDIUM) and Dube's 170.2 (372 balls, MEDIUM) provide genuine firepower.

### Innings Context: Setting vs Chasing (Since 2023)

| Phase | Setting SR | Chasing SR | Delta |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Powerplay | 143.1 | 139.7 | -3.4 |
| Middle | 140.6 | 130.6 | -10.0 |
| Death | 171.1 | 161.2 | -9.9 |
| **Overall** | **150.0** | **139.9** | **-10.1** |

Unlike most teams, CSK bat materially better when setting a total. The middle-overs chasing SR of 130.6 is 10 points below their setting SR, suggesting a structural difficulty with run chases. When batting second, CSK's dot ball rate in the middle overs (29.4%) is essentially identical to their setting dot rate (29.2%), meaning they struggle to find boundaries under chase pressure, not to rotate strike. This is a team that should bat first when given the option.

## Venue Analysis: MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai

Chepauk's reputation as a spin paradise is well earned, but the data reveals a more nuanced picture. Since 2023, across 24 matches at the venue:

**Chepauk Phase Profile (Since 2023, aggregated across innings)**

| Phase | Run Rate (RPO) | Boundary % | Dot Ball % | Wkts/Match |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Powerplay | 8.74 | 22.1% | 40.4% | 1.5 |
| Middle | 7.47 | 11.2% | 31.1% | 2.7 |
| Death | 9.90 | 19.5% | 32.1% | 2.3 |

**vs. League Averages (All Venues)**

| Phase | Chepauk RPO | League RPO | Delta |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Powerplay | 8.74 | 9.39 | -0.65 |
| Middle | 7.47 | 8.89 | -1.42 |
| Death | 9.90 | 10.89 | -0.99 |

Chepauk is a low-scoring ground across all three phases. The middle overs are where the venue diverges most dramatically from the league: 7.47 RPO against the league's 8.89, a 1.42-run deficit. The boundary percentage in the middle overs (11.2%) is nearly 6 percentage points below the league average (17.3%). This is a venue that suffocates batting through overs 7-15, which is precisely where Noor Ahmad operates.

**How CSK's Strengths Fit the Venue:**
- Noor Ahmad's 7.96 economy at Chepauk across 7 matches with 13 wickets is genuinely elite. The venue amplifies his wrist-spin: lower bounce, more grip, less boundary access for batters
- Khaleel Ahmed's 7.75 economy at Chepauk (7 matches, 10 wickets) is significantly better than his overall 9.69 career economy. The venue suppresses pace-hitting
- Gaikwad's 760 runs at Chepauk at 141.8 SR (536 balls, HIGH) shows a batter ideally suited to his home ground's tempo
- The risk: Chepauk's slow middle overs demand a genuine off-spinner to exploit the conditions. CSK's off-spin depth rating of 2.4/10 means they can't fully weaponize their own home ground

**CSK home record since 2023:** 11-10 (52.4% win rate). That's below the franchise's historical standard, and a declining trend (2023: strong, 2025: poor). The average batting score at Chepauk (167.2) is well below the league's scoring benchmarks, confirming this is a bowler's ground. CSK's bowling attack is built for it. The batting order needs to accept that 170 is often enough at Chepauk.

## Schedule Analysis

**Status: IPL 2026 schedule has not been released.**

When the schedule drops, this section will cover:
- **Home/away split:** How many Chepauk matches vs. away games, and what that means for squad selection (spin-heavy at home, pace rotation away)
- **Cluster analysis:** Whether CSK face top-4 contenders in bunches or nicely spread out
- **Rest days:** Particularly relevant for Dhoni's workload management at 43 and Khaleel's pace workload
- **Travel burden:** Distance between consecutive venues and its impact on recovery
- **Early vs. late difficulty:** Whether the tough fixtures come before the squad has settled its best XII

## Head-to-Head Record

### Since 2023 (Current Form Window, from stat pack)

| Opponent | All-Time Record | All-Time Win % | Key Pattern |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| SRH | 15-7 | 68.2% | CSK's most dominant all-time matchup |
| KKR | 20-11 | 64.5% | Historically dominant, but KKR's recent spin attack may shift this |
| DC | 19-12 | 61.3% | CSK's second-best all-time record |
| RCB | 21-13 | 61.8% | The original rivalry. CSK's comfort zone |
| RR | 16-15 | 51.6% | Tight matches; Samson now switching sides adds intrigue |
| PBKS | 16-15 | 50.0% | Coin flip. No pattern to exploit |
| GT | 4-4 | 50.0% | Small sample, too early to read |
| MI | 18-21 | 46.2% | CSK's worst record against a major rival. Wankhede is the villain |
| LSG | 2-3 | 33.3% | Small sample, but CSK have struggled |

**All-Time: 131-100 (56.7% win rate)**

**What the Numbers Say:**

The SRH dominance (68.2%) and KKR record (64.5%) are the franchise's historical calling cards. CSK have traditionally owned spin-light teams and struggled against pace-heavy opposition at venues outside Chennai. The MI problem (46.2%) is the longest-running antagonism in the IPL: Mumbai's pace battery at Wankhede has been CSK's kryptonite for a decade and a half.

The 2026 matchup dynamics shift with Samson now playing for CSK instead of against them. CSK's batting matchup data against Rajasthan Royals (147.7 SR, 260 balls) gets rewritten with their former opponent now in their lineup. Every head-to-head calculation involving Samson's impact needs recalibration.

## Players to Watch

### Noor Ahmad: The 20-Year-Old Carrying the Bowling

48 IPL wickets at 8.24 economy across 132 overs (HIGH). At 20 years old, Noor Ahmad is already the most important bowler in CSK's squad. His middle-overs economy of 7.90 across 102 overs (HIGH) is elite by any standard, and he bowls 77.1% of his overs in that phase. But the stat that demands attention is his death-overs performance: 7.65 economy and 13 wickets in 21.2 overs (HIGH) at the death, with a 42.5% dot ball percentage. For a wrist spinner to bowl at the death and concede less than 8 an over is genuinely rare. Against KKR, his numbers are absurd: 5.90 economy with 7 wickets in 60 balls (MEDIUM). He's picking up batters like he has the source code. The workload concern is real: 132 overs in two seasons is heavy for a 20-year-old wrist spinner. CSK's entire bowling strategy pivots on his left shoulder.

### Sanju Samson: The Successor Who Must Not Fail

151.0 SR across 780 balls since 2023 (HIGH), with an average of 38.0. Samson's numbers are beyond reproach: 191.7 SR at the death (407 balls, MEDIUM), 181.7 against leg-spin (93 balls, MEDIUM), 165.6 against fast-medium bowling (189 balls, MEDIUM). He's the most complete wicketkeeper-batter in the IPL's current generation. But he arrives at CSK with a specific burden: he is the long-term Dhoni replacement. Not just behind the stumps, but in the dressing room. At 30, he has 38 IPL innings since 2023, 9 fifties, and a pressure rating of PRESSURE_PROOF (4.7% SR uplift under pressure, 223 balls, HIGH confidence). The question is not whether Samson is good enough. It is whether the franchise can deploy him in a role that maximizes his strengths: opening, keeping wicket, and finishing if needed. His 201 SR in EXTREME pressure (73 balls, MEDIUM) is the most reassuring number in this entire squad profile.

### MS Dhoni: The Last Dance

170.1 career SR across 271 balls since 2023 (HIGH). The numbers still command respect. But the trajectory is unmistakable: 196.3 SR in 2024, 127.3 in 2025. His last 10 innings show 129.3 SR with a -8.9 delta from career. His CLUTCH pressure rating (12.4% SR uplift, 110 balls, HIGH confidence) tells you something the recent form doesn't: Dhoni still rises in moments that matter. The 183.0 SR at the death across 241 balls (for CSK specifically) remains the single most iconic statistical identity in the franchise's history. At 43, every match is a potential farewell. The coaching staff's challenge is deploying him where his declining physical attributes matter least and his psychological presence matters most: overs 16-20, with the game on the line.

### Shivam Dube: The Middle-Overs Anchor

151.1 SR across 775 balls since 2023 (HIGH). Dube's value to CSK is hiding in the middle overs: 136.3 SR across 873 balls (HIGH) with 1,190 runs. He is the only batter in the squad who can occupy the middle overs for extended periods without either stalling or self-destructing. His 166.3 SR against leg-spin (92 balls, MEDIUM) and 170.2 SR at the death (372 balls, MEDIUM) provide genuine finishing capability. The concern: his 2025 SR dropped to 123.5, a 29.4-point decline from 152.9 in 2024. The L10 delta (-11.5 from career) confirms the dip is real, not noise. If Dube returns to his 150+ SR self, CSK's middle order functions. If the 2025 slump continues, the batting collapses become structural.

## Players Who Need to Step Up

**1. Ayush Mhatre: The Uncapped Powerplay Spark**

CSK's powerplay batting SR of 137.2 in 2025 is 9 points below the league average. Mhatre (0.30 Cr, retained) is the Founder's pick to open alongside Samson, and his 189.0 SR across 127 balls (LOW) demands attention. His 257.6 SR against fast bowling (59 balls, MEDIUM) is genuinely startling. But the sample is tiny, and his 128.3 SR against fast-medium (46 balls, LOW) suggests the variation between high pace and medium pace matters. At 7 IPL innings, he is a projection, not a certainty. The step-up: survive the powerplay consistently enough to let Samson attack, and push the team PP SR back above 145.

**2. Dewald Brevis: Unlocking the Middle-Order X-Factor**

Brevis (2.20 Cr, retained) has 294 runs at 159.8 SR across just 9 IPL innings since 2023 (LOW). The sample is frustratingly small for a player with this much raw ability. His 204.0 SR against fast-medium (50 balls, MEDIUM) and 155.1 SR in the middle overs (207 balls, MEDIUM) suggest a genuine middle-order weapon. The step-up: play 12+ matches and convert his franchise-league form (SA20: 148.8 SR, CSA: 149.0 SR) into sustained IPL production. At 22, the talent is unquestioned. The consistency is not.

**3. Nathan Ellis: Becoming the Death-Overs Solution**

CSK's death bowling economy of 10.92 in 2025 was adequate but not dominant. Ellis (2.00 Cr, retained) offers the profile to fix it: 10.47 death economy across 17 overs (MEDIUM) with 6 wickets, and a 7.17 powerplay economy (12 overs, MEDIUM) that suggests genuine new-ball ability. His 7.47 middle-overs economy (17 overs, MEDIUM) makes him the most phase-flexible pacer in the squad. The step-up: take over from Pathirana as the designated death specialist and give Khaleel Ahmed the freedom to focus on powerplay aggression. If Ellis can deliver 3 overs at under 10.0 economy at the death across 14 matches, CSK's bowling picture changes fundamentally.

## Recent Form

### Batters (IPL Recent Form)

| Player | L10 SR | Career SR | SR Delta | L10 Avg | Trend |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Ruturaj Gaikwad | 133.0 | 145.3 | -5.2 | 28.7 | Moderate dip |
| Sanju Samson | 139.2 | 151.0 | -0.5 | 29.5 | Stable |
| Shivam Dube | 132.6 | 151.1 | -11.5 | 41.9 | Steep decline |
| Dewald Brevis | 152.5 | 159.8 | -0.7 | 33.1 | Stable |
| MS Dhoni | 129.3 | 170.1 | -8.9 | 21.4 | Steep decline |
| Ayush Mhatre | 189.0 | 189.0 | 0.0 | 34.3 | Insufficient history |

*Samson's L10 is split across franchises (RR/CSK trade). Dhoni's L20 SR of 155.2 (192 balls) was stronger, suggesting the L10 represents a recent acute dip rather than a permanent decline.*

**What the Form Tells You:** Two batters are in steep decline. Dhoni's -8.9 SR delta is the most concerning given his age (43), though his L20 of 155.2 shows the decline is concentrated in the final stretch of 2025. Dube's -11.5 delta is the more structurally worrying number because he's 31 and should be in his peak years. If both return to their career averages, CSK's batting improves by approximately 15-20 SR points in the death overs alone. If neither does, the franchise is carrying two underperformers in its top 7.

### Bowlers (IPL Recent Form)

| Player | L10 Econ | Career Econ | Econ Delta | L10 Wkts | Trend |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| Noor Ahmad | 8.40 | 8.24 | +0.16 | 14 | Stable-elite |
| Khaleel Ahmed | 10.83 | 9.69 | +1.68 | 7 | Concerning |
| Nathan Ellis | 8.90 | 8.80 | +0.12 | 10 | Stable |
| Anshul Kamboj | 8.91 | 9.14 | -0.23 | 9 | Improving |
| Rahul Chahar | 9.03 | 8.29 | +1.22 | 10 | Economy pressure |

**Khaleel Ahmed is the red flag.** His L10 economy of 10.83 is 1.68 runs above his career mark, driven by a death-overs economy of 11.58 across 30.7 overs (HIGH). He took 18 death-overs wickets, but at a ruinous cost. Noor Ahmad's stability (8.40 vs 8.24 career, +0.16) is the bowling unit's anchor. Ellis at 8.90 is quietly solid. Kamboj is the only bowler trending in the right direction (-0.23).

### Bowlers (Individual Phase Economies, Since 2023)

| Player | Primary Phase | Econ (Primary) | Secondary Phase | Econ (Secondary) | Role |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Khaleel Ahmed | PP | 8.45 (86 ov, HIGH) | Death | 11.58 (31 ov, HIGH) | Primary new-ball |
| Noor Ahmad | Middle | 7.90 (102 ov, HIGH) | Death | 7.65 (21.2 ov, HIGH) | Primary middle-overs + death flex |
| Nathan Ellis | PP | 7.17 (12 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 10.47 (17 ov, MEDIUM) | Phase-flexible pacer |
| Anshul Kamboj | PP | 8.58 (26 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 6.00 (0.5 ov, LOW) | PP specialist |
| Rahul Chahar | Middle | 8.01 (69 ov, HIGH) | Death | 9.00 (11.7 ov, HIGH) | Middle-overs leg-spin |

The phase distribution confirms the structural issue: Khaleel's death economy of 11.58 (31 overs, HIGH sample) is 0.7 runs above the league average. He takes wickets (18) but concedes too many runs doing it. The death bowling relies heavily on Noor Ahmad, whose 7.65 economy in 21.2 death overs (HIGH) is genuinely exceptional for a wrist spinner. But asking a 20-year-old to carry both the middle overs (77.1% of his overs) and the death (16.0% of his overs) is a workload equation with no margin for injury.

## Momentum & Scoring Tendencies

### Dot Ball Discipline: Who Rotates, Who Stalls

| Player | PP Dot % | League PP Avg | Middle Dot % | League Mid Avg | Death Dot % | League Death Avg |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Ruturaj Gaikwad | 43.4% | 44.1% | 24.7% | 30.6% | 25.3% | 30.3% |
| Sanju Samson | 47.9% | 44.1% | 28.5% | 30.6% | 24.3% | 30.3% |
| Shivam Dube | -- | -- | 34.6% | 30.6% | 31.7% | 30.3% |
| MS Dhoni | -- | -- | 39.6% | 30.6% | 27.0% | 30.3% |

Gaikwad is the most efficient rotator in the squad: his middle-overs dot ball rate of 24.7% is 5.9 points below the league average. He finds gaps constantly, keeping the scoreboard moving even when boundaries dry up. Samson's powerplay dot rate of 47.9% is a concern, 3.8 points above the league average, suggesting he takes time to settle at the crease. Once established, his middle-overs rotation improves.

Dhoni's 39.6% middle-overs dot rate is the most telling number. At 9 points above the league average, it reflects a batter who has lost the ability to rotate against spin in the middle overs. His 114 SR against spin (all career) vs 178 SR against pace tells the same story from a different angle. In the death overs, his dot rate drops to 27.0%, below league average, because his approach shifts entirely to boundary-hitting.

### Scoring Profiles: Power vs Placement

Samson's death-overs boundary percentage (26.8%) is 21.1% against the league's 23.3%, making him one of the more efficient death-overs boundary hitters in the squad. Dhoni's 23.4% death boundary rate is driven entirely by sixes (his six-to-four ratio in the death overs skews heavily toward clearing the boundary rather than finding the gap). Dube's 22.6% death boundary rate places him third, with a bias toward sixes over fours that reflects his power game.

## Tactical Blueprint: How CSK Deploy Their Weapons

### Batting Order: The Founder's XII

| Batter | Position | Role | Entry Profile |
|--------|----------|------|---------------|
| Sanju Samson | #1 | WK-batter, opener | Opens every innings. Target: settle, then accelerate |
| Ayush Mhatre | #2 | Aggressive opener | PP spark. 189.0 SR says he attacks from ball 1 |
| Ruturaj Gaikwad (c) | #3 | Anchor | Drops from opening to #3. Controls the middle overs |
| Dewald Brevis | #4 | Middle-order accelerator | Enters overs 7-10. 155.1 middle SR |
| Shivam Dube | #5 | Middle-overs anchor / death finisher | 136.3 mid SR, 170.2 death SR |
| Prashant Veer | #6 | All-rounder | Uncapped. Role unclear. Left-arm orthodox with bat |
| MS Dhoni | #7 | Death finisher | Pure death hitter. Enters overs 15-20 only |

The structural shift from 2025 is significant. Gaikwad moves from opener to #3, allowing Samson and Mhatre to set the powerplay tone. This changes CSK's powerplay DNA entirely: from Gaikwad's 128.7 PP SR to Samson and Mhatre's combined aggression. Whether Gaikwad can replicate his 142.5 middle-overs SR at #3 is the key tactical question.

### Bowling Deployment

**Phase allocation:**

| Phase | Pace % | Spin % | Key Pattern |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Powerplay (1-6) | 90%+ | <10% | Khaleel + Kamboj/Ellis dominate |
| Middle (7-15) | 25-35% | 65-75% | Noor Ahmad + Rahul Chahar spin control |
| Death (16-20) | 60-70% | 30-40% | Khaleel returns + Noor Ahmad death flex |

**The Template:** Khaleel opens. Anshul Kamboj or Nathan Ellis partners him. Noor Ahmad enters at over 7 and doesn't leave until over 15 at the earliest. Rahul Chahar provides the secondary spin option. At the death, Khaleel returns alongside Ellis, with Noor Ahmad saved for key overs (19 or 20) if the game demands it.

## Interesting Data Insights

**1. Samson Against Leg-Spin Is a Franchise-Altering Weapon**

Sanju Samson strikes at 181.7 against leg-spin across 93 balls (MEDIUM) since 2023. That's 40.6 points above the league average against leggies. He has been dismissed just twice in those 93 balls, averaging 84.5. At Chepauk, where opposition teams will deploy wrist-spinners to exploit the surface, having a batter who actively targets leg-spin is a genuine tactical advantage that CSK never had with their previous opening combinations. Every opposition captain who plans to bowl leg-spin in the powerplay at Chepauk should know: Samson is waiting for it.

**2. Noor Ahmad's KKR Record Is Borderline Unfair**

5.90 economy with 7 wickets in 60 balls (MEDIUM) against Kolkata Knight Riders. In a league where KKR's batting lineup is among the most destructive, Noor Ahmad treats them like club cricketers. His 45.0% dot ball rate against KKR is the highest he registers against any opposition. The small sample warrants caution, but the pattern is suggestive: KKR's aggressive batting approach plays directly into his wrist-spin variations.

**3. Dhoni's Pace vs Spin Split Is the Story of Ageing in Cricket**

Since 2023, MS Dhoni strikes at 198.8 SR against fast bowling (82 balls, MEDIUM) and 219.1 against fast-medium (63 balls, MEDIUM). Against pace, he remains genuinely elite. Against leg-spin: 112.8 SR (39 balls, LOW). Against off-spin: 85.7 (14 balls, LOW). The pattern is unmistakable: at 43, his hand-eye coordination and bat speed against pace remain extraordinary, but the slower the bowling, the more time he has to overthink. His death-overs SR of 176.5 (1965 balls, HIGH) is overwhelmingly a pace-hitting number. At Chepauk, where spin dominates the middle overs, keeping Dhoni away from overs 7-15 is not a luxury; it's a necessity.

**4. Gaikwad's Middle-Overs Efficiency Is Hiding in Plain Sight**

Ruturaj Gaikwad's middle-overs dot ball rate of 24.7% (732 balls, HIGH) is 5.9 points below the league average of 30.6%. That makes him the most efficient rotator in the CSK squad and one of the best in the league. His 142.5 middle-overs SR is adequate, not explosive, but the low dot rate means he never lets the scoring rate stall entirely. In a team that struggles to maintain run rate through the middle overs (131.1 SR in 2025), Gaikwad's ability to keep the scoreboard ticking is worth more than his headline strike rate suggests.

**5. The 14.20 Cr Gamble Nobody Can Evaluate**

Prashant Veer and Kartik Sharma cost CSK a combined 28.40 Cr at auction. Neither has a single IPL ball to their name. Prashant Veer's entire bowling database consists of 18 balls in SMAT at 2.3 economy. Kartik Sharma's batting profile shows 35 runs from 21 IPL balls at 166.7 SR, but that's from a different franchise and a vanishingly small sample. CSK have committed nearly 25% of their total squad salary to two players with zero proof of IPL viability. In the history of the IPL, no franchise has wagered this much on this little evidence. It's either visionary talent identification or the most expensive gamble since the 2011 mega auction.

---

## The Bold Take

**Noor Ahmad, not Ruturaj Gaikwad, is the most important player in CSK's squad.**

This will feel wrong to most CSK fans. Gaikwad is the captain. He has 1,295 runs at 145.3 SR across 891 balls (HIGH). He's the face of the post-Dhoni era. But consider: take Gaikwad out, and CSK still have Samson (151.0 SR, 780 balls), Dube (151.1 SR, 775 balls), and Brevis (159.8 SR, 184 balls) to score runs. The batting doesn't collapse; it reshuffles. Now take Noor Ahmad out. His 7.90 economy across 102 middle overs is irreplaceable. Rahul Chahar (8.01 economy, similar phase) is a backup, not a substitute -- his wicket-taking rate is roughly half of Noor Ahmad's. Without Noor Ahmad, CSK's middle-overs bowling reverts to the 8.74 economy of 2025, and their death bowling loses its only sub-8.0 option. The entire bowling strategy -- suffocate in the middle, attack at the death with spin -- evaporates. At 10.00 Cr, Noor Ahmad is the most underpriced retention in CSK's history relative to his tactical importance. His 48 wickets in 37 matches since 2023 is a rate of 1.3 wickets per match, among the highest for any spinner in the league. CSK's season rises and falls with a 20-year-old from Afghanistan. That's not hyperbole. That's the data.

---

## By the Numbers

| Stat | Value | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| **28.6%** | CSK's 2025 win rate | The worst in franchise history. From title winners (62.5%) in 2023 to bottom-dwellers in two seasons |
| **7.65** | Noor Ahmad's death economy (21.2 overs, HIGH) | A wrist spinner conceding under 8 at the death. The rarest skill in T20 cricket |
| **-69.0** | Dhoni's SR delta (2024 to 2025) | From 196.3 to 127.3 in one season. The steepest single-year decline of his career |
| **181.7** | Samson's SR vs leg-spin (93 balls, MEDIUM) | 40.6 points above the league average. The best leg-spin matchup in the CSK squad |
| **28.40 Cr** | Combined auction spend on Prashant Veer + Kartik Sharma | Zero IPL data between them. The biggest leap of faith in IPL 2026 |

## Keys to Victory

**1. Noor Ahmad Must Bowl 40+ Overs Across the Tournament**

CSK's bowling strategy collapses without him. His 7.90 middle-overs economy and 7.65 death economy are the twin pillars of the entire bowling plan. If he bowls fewer than 3.5 overs per match due to injury, rest, or tactical error, the middle-overs bowling economy could regress by 0.5-1.0 RPO based on Rahul Chahar's 8.01 economy as the replacement. The coaching staff must manage his workload ruthlessly: bowl him through overs 7-15, give him one death over, and protect him on days when the match is already decided.

**2. The Powerplay Must Improve by 8+ SR Points**

CSK's 137.2 PP SR in 2025 was 9.1 points below the league average of 146.3. Samson (124.1 PP SR career, HIGH) is not a natural powerplay aggressor, and Mhatre's 189.0 SR is from just 127 balls. The new opening pair needs to collectively push the PP SR above 145. If they can't, CSK start every innings at a deficit that the middle overs and death overs have to make up -- and neither phase is strong enough to consistently compensate.

**3. Dhoni's Role Must Be Defined and Protected**

Dhoni at 43 cannot bat through an innings. His middle-overs dot rate (39.6%) and spin SR (114) make him a liability between overs 7-15. His death SR (176.5 career, 183.0 at Chepauk) makes him an asset in overs 16-20. The coaching staff must resist the temptation to promote him up the order or use him as a stabilizer. His role is specific: bat #7, face 10-15 balls at the death, hit at 170+ SR, and leave. Any deviation from this template risks exposing his weaknesses at the expense of his strengths.

**4. Overseas Slot Management Must Balance Risk and Reward**

CSK have 8 overseas players but can only play 4. Brevis (middle-order batting), Noor Ahmad (bowling spine), and Ellis (phase-flexible pace) should be locked in. The fourth slot is the puzzle: Jamie Overton (pace AR with 14.0 economy in 6 IPL overs -- concerning), Matt Henry (8.0 cross-tournament econ, 1 IPL wicket), Akeal Hosein (7.0 cross-tournament econ, 1 IPL match), or Zak Foulkes (8.1 T20 econ, uncapped IPL). The coaching staff must audition early and commit by match 5. Rotating the fourth overseas slot based on match situation (Overton for batting depth, Hosein for spin depth) requires tactical clarity that CSK's 2025 season lacked.

---

## Andy Flower's Scouting Report

**Tactical Identity:** Spin-anchored, transition-mode. CSK's game plan is to survive the powerplay with adequate batting, control the middle overs through Noor Ahmad's wrist-spin, and exploit the death overs via Samson, Dube, and Dhoni's finishing. The template is defensive-by-design: restrict, accumulate, finish.

**Structural Strengths:**
- Middle-overs bowling (Noor Ahmad at 7.90 economy, 102 overs, HIGH) is elite and venue-optimized for Chepauk
- Death-overs batting depth (Samson 191.7 SR / 407 balls, Dhoni 176.5 SR / 1965 balls, Dube 170.2 SR / 372 balls) gives three finishing options
- Chepauk's low-scoring conditions (7.47 middle-overs RPO vs 8.89 league) amplify the bowling attack's effectiveness
- Gaikwad's middle-overs efficiency (24.7% dot rate, 732 balls, HIGH) keeps the scoreboard ticking

**Structural Vulnerabilities:**
- Powerplay batting (137.2 SR, 2025) is the weakest phase in the squad; Samson's career PP SR of 124.1 won't fix it alone
- Off-spin depth is effectively absent (2.4/10 rating) -- cannot exploit left-handers in the middle overs
- Death bowling relies on Khaleel (11.58 death econ, HIGH) who concedes too many runs for his wickets
- Three players costing 32.40 Cr (Prashant Veer, Kartik Sharma, Samson) have zero or minimal CSK-context data
- Dhoni's decline (-69.0 SR in one season) creates a death-overs vulnerability if Samson and Dube don't compensate
- Middle-overs batting (131.1 SR, 2025) is below league average and overly dependent on Gaikwad and Dube

**Opposition Blueprint:** Attack the powerplay. CSK's 137.2 PP SR and 2.1 wickets lost per innings in 2025 mean early aggression from the bowling side pays off. Bowl off-spin in the middle overs -- CSK's batters (Gaikwad 125.0, Dube 118.0) are collectively below the league average against off-spinners. If batting first, target 180+: CSK's chasing SR of 139.9 (vs 150.0 setting SR) means they are significantly worse in the second innings. Do not bowl pace to Dhoni at the death. Do not bowl leg-spin to Samson at any point.

**Matchup Targets:** Dube's off-spin vulnerability (117.98 SR, 89 balls, MEDIUM) is exploitable with any quality off-spinner. Samson's left-arm orthodox weakness (115.1 SR, 86 balls, MEDIUM) is a high-confidence target. Gaikwad's powerplay SR of 128.7 makes him containable if you can keep the field restrictions from hurting you. Dhoni should face zero spin deliveries -- his 112.8 SR against leg-spin and 85.7 against off-spin since 2023 confirm the vulnerability is real and growing.

---

## Verdict

CSK in 2026 is a franchise doing the hardest thing in professional sport: rebuilding in broad daylight while the greatest player in their history takes his final bow. The pieces are there -- Samson's batting, Noor Ahmad's bowling, Gaikwad's captaincy -- but the cement hasn't dried. If the 28.40 Cr gamble on uncapped players pays off and Dhoni's decline doesn't accelerate, this is a playoff-capable squad. If the transition stumbles, the dynasty's final chapter will be remembered for how it ended, not how long it lasted.

**Projected Finish: 5th-7th** | **Ceiling: 4th (Playoffs)** | **Floor: 9th**
