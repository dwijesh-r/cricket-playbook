**Document:** TKT-165 Deliverable
**Author:** Andy Flower (Cricket Domain Specialist & Tactical Insights Lead)
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Version:** 1.0
**Sources:** All 10 IPL 2026 team stat packs, predicted XII (SUPER SELECTOR v3.0), depth charts (v1.0)
**Data Coverage:** 280 classified IPL bowlers, 98.8% ball coverage, 3 seasons (2023-2025)

## Methodology

Every insight in this document is traceable to either:
1. Ball-by-ball data surfaced through the Cricket Playbook analytics engine
2. Phase-specific metrics (powerplay overs 1-6, middle overs 7-15, death overs 16-20)
3. Bowling-type matchup matrices (off-spin, leg-spin, LA orthodox, LA wrist spin, pace)
4. K-means clustering archetypes
5. Season-over-season form trajectories (2023, 2024, 2025)

No predictions are made. No hype is applied. Where data is insufficient, I say so.

## Part 1: Team-by-Team Tactical Analysis

---

### 1. Chennai Super Kings (CSK)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.4/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 62.5% -> 50% -> 28.6% (declining)

#### Insight 1: The Lead Pacer Vacuum Is Structural, Not Cosmetic

CSK's depth chart rates Lead Pacer at 4.6/10, with Anshul Kamboj (score: 47.0) and Khaleel Ahmed (score: 45.0) as the top two options. Neither has a career T20 profile that justifies lead-pacer billing. The predicted XII lists Khaleel at 11 and Ellis at 8, but neither bowler is tagged as a "proven wicket taker" in the new-ball phase. Noor Ahmad (10 Cr, overseas) is classified as a left-arm wrist spinner but bowls at death (7.65 economy, 13 wickets, 68.8% of his overs in death phase). CSK's pace bowling is a supporting cast without a lead actor.

**Coaching implication:** Opponents will target the powerplay against CSK's pace options. At Chepauk, where spin SR is 26.6 and pace SR is 28.2, the powerplay becomes the phase where CSK leaks early momentum. They compensate at death through Noor Ahmad and Ellis, but the damage may already be done.

#### Insight 2: Shivam Dube's Strike Rate Decline Is Phase-Specific

Dube's career SR progression reads 152.9 -> 140.3 -> 123.5. But the stat pack reveals this is not a general decline. His middle-overs role is unchanged. The decline concentrates in the death phase, where his SR has compressed from 170+ to approximately 130. His consistency index (51) is middling. The depth chart still rates him 92.4 as the No.1 middle order option, but that score was computed before 2025's decline fully factored.

**Coaching implication:** Dube at 4 in the predicted XII works only if Samson and Brevis absorb death-phase acceleration. If Dube bats at death, CSK are under-powered against quality pace.

#### Insight 3: MS Dhoni's Spin Vulnerability Has Gone From Exploitable to Critical

Dhoni's SR trajectory: 196.3 -> 136.9 -> 127.3. The stat pack identifies a specific vulnerability against left-arm orthodox bowling. At 44, this is consistent with aging-batter profiles where reaction time degrades against slower, turning deliveries before it degrades against pace. The predicted XII slots Dhoni at 9 (finisher role), which limits exposure, but any promotion up the order would be structurally unsound.

**Coaching implication:** Opposition teams with quality LA orthodox (think Jadeja, Sai Kishore, Axar, Sundar) should target Dhoni specifically. Dhoni at 9 is an acknowledgment of reduced capability, not a tactical choice.

#### Insight 4: Samson's Trade Changes CSK's Batting Architecture Entirely

Samson (18 Cr, traded from RR) is slotted at No. 2 as wicketkeeper with a "death-overs finisher" tag. His depth chart scores are: Finisher 100.0, No.3 Batter 100.0, Wicketkeeper 89.4. This gives CSK the death-phase firepower that Dube can no longer provide and replaces Dhoni's declining keeping. The problem is that Samson's quality creates dependency: he appears as the No.1 option in four depth chart positions simultaneously.

**Coaching implication:** If Samson fails or is injured, CSK have no comparable replacement across any of those four roles. Kartik Sharma (backup keeper, score: 49.4) is a significant drop-off. CSK's ceiling rose with this trade, but their floor dropped.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

The stat pack correctly identifies the death bowling strength (Noor Ahmad) and the Dhoni vulnerability, but underweights the lead pacer crisis and doesn't examine Samson's multi-role dependency risk.

---

### 2. Mumbai Indians (MI)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 8.6/10 (highest in league) | **Season Trajectory:** 56.2% -> 28.6% -> 56.2% (volatile)

#### Insight 1: Bumrah's Death Bowling Is a League-Wide Anomaly

Bumrah's death-phase numbers: 6.75 economy, 21 wickets, 55.3% of his wickets from 33.4% of his overs bowled at death. No other bowler in the dataset produces this efficiency ratio. His death dot-ball percentage is the highest among frontline quicks. The gap between Bumrah and MI's second-best death option is the largest gap at any single position for any team in the league.

**Coaching implication:** MI's entire death-phase strategy is Bumrah-dependent. When Bumrah was unavailable in 2024 (the 28.6% win-rate season), MI collapsed. The predicted XII's bowling depth (Boult, Chahar, Izhar, Santner) provides variety but not a Bumrah replacement at death. This is a known single point of failure that MI have not structurally addressed.

#### Insight 2: QdK's Off-Spin Vulnerability Is Matchup-Significant

Quinton de Kock's off-spin SR: 109.52 (well below his career 145.68 SR). This is the kind of number that changes how you bowl in the powerplay. KKR (Varun Chakravarthy + Narine), RCB (Krunal Pandya), and GT (Washington Sundar) all have off-spin options they could deploy inside the powerplay against QdK if they do their homework.

**Coaching implication:** QdK opening with Rohit means MI's powerplay can be throttled by any team willing to use off-spin early. QdK's position at 2 in the XI with "Left-hand" batting hand creates a left-right combination with Rohit, which is sound, but the off-spin vulnerability negates that advantage against prepared opponents.

#### Insight 3: Tilak Varma's Decline Needs Context

Tilak Varma's SR declined by 10.6 points season-over-season. The depth chart still rates him 94.5 at No.3 and 66.2 as opener. His role in the predicted XI is at 5 (lower than his depth chart ranking suggests). This positional mismatch indicates the SUPER SELECTOR algorithm deprioritized him from the top 3 due to recent form regression, but the depth chart (built on career data) still rates him highly. The gap between these two assessments is itself the insight: Tilak Varma is in a form trough, and MI are hedging.

**Coaching implication:** If Tilak bats at 5, MI's middle overs become Rohit-QdK-SKY-Jacks heavy at the top with Hardik at 6. Tilak at 5 is an underutilization of his ceiling. This is a coaching decision worth monitoring early in the season.

#### Insight 4: SKY vs CSK Is a Known Cold Spot

Suryakumar Yadav's career SR is 172.93, but against CSK it drops to 125.57. The stat pack flags this as a specific opposition matchup vulnerability. Given that CSK's spin-heavy bowling (Noor Ahmad, Rahul Chahar, Akeal Hosein) plays to their home ground bias, this matchup is not random. SKY's reduced performance against CSK correlates with spin-heavy attacks at Chepauk.

**Coaching implication:** In MI vs CSK, the batting order may need to adjust SKY's role or surround him with spin-dominant batters. This is a fixture-specific tactical insight, not a general weakness.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **APPROVE**

The MI stat pack is the strongest in the set. The Bumrah dependency, QdK spin vulnerability, and opposition matchup data are all clearly surfaced and analytically sound.

---

### 3. Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 8.1/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 50% -> 46.7% -> 73.3% (ascending)

#### Insight 1: The Predicted XI Has a Constraint Violation, and That Matters

RCB's predicted XII is the only one flagged with `constraints_satisfied: false`. The violation: "C4: Insufficient primary bowling options (3/4)." The XI picks four overseas slots (Salt, Tim David, Hazlewood, Jordan Cox) and lists only 5 bowling options total. Cox at 11 is classified as a "Pace Bowler" but is actually a wicketkeeper by trade (the rationale literally says "Primary wicketkeeper"). This means the SUPER SELECTOR produced a structurally flawed XI for RCB. The real bowling attack is Hazlewood, Bhuvi, Krunal, and part-timers.

**Coaching implication:** RCB's actual bowling depth is thinner than the numbers suggest. Suyash Sharma (death bowling: 10.33 economy, 2 wickets) is not in the XI. RCB will need to use the impact player substitution tactically to address bowling shortfalls on match day.

#### Insight 2: Krunal Pandya's Off-Spin Vulnerability Is Career-Defining

Krunal Pandya vs off-spin: 67.35 SR, 7.33 average, 6.91 BPD. These are not marginal weaknesses. They are among the worst off-spin matchup numbers for any batter in the dataset who bats in the top 8. Krunal bats at 8 in the predicted XI, which limits exposure, but as a left-arm spin all-rounder, he will often bat in the middle overs where off-spin is deployed specifically to target him.

**Coaching implication:** Any opponent with a quality off-spinner should bowl them when Krunal is on strike. This is textbook matchup exploitation. Krunal's bowling value (middle-overs spin control) keeps him in the XI, but his batting is a known liability when the bowling type is targeted.

#### Insight 3: Chinnaswamy's Home Record Is Below 50%, and RCB Keep Ignoring It

RCB's home win rate at Chinnaswamy: 47.4%. The venue is classified as pace-biased. RCB's bowling is Hazlewood + Bhuvi (pace) and Krunal (spin), which should suit the venue. But the batting lineup has multiple spin vulnerabilities (Padikkal vs specific bowling types, Jitesh Sharma flagged in the stat pack). The problem is that opponents bring their best pace attacks to Chinnaswamy's short boundaries, and RCB's batting collapses against quality pace more often than the raw totals suggest.

**Coaching implication:** RCB's 73.3% win rate in 2025 may have been driven by away performance or fixture luck. The structural mismatch between Chinnaswamy conditions and RCB's bowling options has not been resolved.

#### Insight 4: Kohli at 21 Cr Anchors Everything

Kohli: 2037 runs in 44 innings across the data window. He is the single highest run accumulator in the dataset. At 21 Cr, he is the most expensive Indian retention. His role at 2 in the predicted XI as "Elite top-order anchor" is supported by data. But Kohli's value also masks a deeper question: when Kohli fails in the powerplay (SR < 120 in first 3 overs), does RCB's middle order compensate? The stat pack does not directly answer this, and the depth chart shows Chinnaswamy's batting cushion papers over middle-order fragility.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

Correctly identifies Krunal and Jitesh vulnerabilities, but does not surface the predicted XI constraint violation or interrogate the Chinnaswamy home-record anomaly.

---

### 4. Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 6.9/10 (lowest in league) | **Season Trajectory:** 42.9% -> 78.6% -> 38.5% (volatile)

#### Insight 1: Cameron Green at 25.2 Cr Is the Largest Single-Player Investment Risk

Green is slotted at 5 as an all-rounder in the predicted XI. The depth chart rates KKR's overall depth at 6.9, the lowest of all 10 teams. Green's 25.2 Cr is 23.4% of KKR's total spend. Three of KKR's top depth chart positions are overseas-dependent (Opener, No.3 Batter, Wicketkeeper). Green takes one of four overseas slots and must deliver both batting runs at 5 and bowling overs. If Green underperforms, KKR's structural thin depth means there is no comparable backup.

**Coaching implication:** KKR's 2026 campaign is essentially a bet on Cameron Green justifying 25.2 Cr. The depth chart's 6.9 rating confirms that the squad was built around a few high-ceiling players rather than balanced depth.

#### Insight 2: Pathirana's Death Dominance Is Elite but Narrow

Pathirana: 64.2 overs at death, 33 wickets, 8.65 economy. 73.3% of his wickets come at death. This is the second-most death-concentrated wicket distribution after Bumrah. The problem is Pathirana's economy (8.65) is significantly worse than Bumrah's (6.75). Pathirana takes wickets at death but concedes runs doing so. At Eden Gardens, where the spin SR is 26.3 (neutral), Pathirana's value is as a wicket-taker, not an economy bowler.

**Coaching implication:** KKR need to pair Pathirana with an economy bowler at death. Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora are the options, but neither has established death-phase credentials in the stat pack data.

#### Insight 3: Rinku Singh's Off-Spin Vulnerability Contradicts His Role

Rinku Singh vs off-spin: 85.96 SR. Rinku's role is "Finisher" at No. 6. Finishers face middle-overs spin more often than any other bowling type in that batting position. An 85.96 SR against off-spin is not a finisher's profile; it is an accumulator's profile. KKR's predicted XI has Rinku at 6 with Cameron Green at 5, meaning Rinku inherits the middle-overs spin phase that Green's left-hand bat is designed to counteract. If Green falls early, Rinku is exposed to exactly the bowling type he struggles against.

**Coaching implication:** KKR should consider batting Rinku at 7 or below when facing off-spin-heavy attacks (MI with Santner, DC with Axar, GT with Sundar).

#### Insight 4: Narine's Age-Adjusted Value Is Underexamined

Narine opens at 1 in the predicted XI with a "Powerplay aggressor" tag. His bowling economy has trended 8.27 -> 7.98 -> 7.6, which is improving. But Narine vs MI has a career SR of 87.93 and an average of 4.64. This is the single worst opposition batting matchup in the entire dataset for any player classified as an opener. It means in KKR vs MI, Narine's opening role is statistically indefensible. His bowling value keeps him in the XI, but his batting position should be matchup-dependent.

**Coaching implication:** Against MI specifically, KKR should consider pushing Narine down the order and opening with Rahane + Finn Allen/Tripathi. This is a data-backed fixture-level adjustment.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CHALLENGE**

The stat pack surfaces Pathirana's death numbers and Rinku's off-spin weakness, but fails to address the Green concentration risk, KKR's league-lowest depth rating, or Narine's MI-specific batting collapse. The volatility pattern (78.6% to 38.5%) is unexplained.

---

### 5. Rajasthan Royals (RR)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.4/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 50% -> 60% -> 28.6% (declining sharply)

#### Insight 1: Every Death Bowler Has an Economy Above 10

RR's death bowling is the weakest in the league by economy rate. Every classified death bowler in the stat pack (Archer, Sam Curran, Sandeep Sharma) has an economy above 10 in the death phase. Sandeep Sharma is flagged as a death "over-performer" (+34.1 efficiency), but this is relative to his baseline, not an absolute quality measure. An over-performer who still leaks runs at 10+ economy is still leaking runs.

**Coaching implication:** RR's decline from 60% to 28.6% correlates directly with death-phase bowling collapse. Jofra Archer's presence in the predicted XI at 9 should help, but Archer's fitness record creates availability risk. Without a reliable sub-9.0 economy death bowler, RR will hemorrhage close games.

#### Insight 2: Jaiswal's Powerplay Dominance Is Genuine

Jaiswal: 159.49 powerplay SR. This is the highest in the dataset among openers with more than 20 innings. Jaiswal at 1 in the predicted XI is data-supported. But RR's issue is that Jaiswal's powerplay production creates a dependence pattern: when Jaiswal scores 30+ in the powerplay, RR's win rate is significantly higher than when he is dismissed early. The predicted XI has Hetmyer at 2, which is an unusual choice (Hetmyer is a "Finisher" role tag, not an opener). This opening combination lacks an anchor if Jaiswal falls early.

**Coaching implication:** The Jaiswal-Hetmyer opening pairing is high-variance. If both fire, the powerplay total will be elite. If both fall cheaply, RR's middle order (Ravi Singh at 3, a 0.3 Cr player) is structurally underequipped.

#### Insight 3: Jadeja's Trade Creates a Bowling Solution but a Matchup Problem

Jadeja (17.5 Cr, traded from CSK) is at 7 as an all-rounder. His bowling tag is "Spin bowling strength in middle overs." But the stat pack identifies Jadeja's specific vulnerability: leg-spin (105.15 SR). RR play at Sawai Mansingh (40% home win rate), a neutral venue. Jadeja's value is as a bowling all-rounder, but teams with quality leg-spin (KKR's Varun, PBKS's Chahal, GT's Rashid) can target his batting specifically.

**Coaching implication:** Jadeja at 7 is reasonable for bowling utility, but his batting contribution may be matchup-limited against leg-spin-heavy sides.

#### Insight 4: Sawai Mansingh's 40% Home Win Rate Is a Venue Problem, Not a Team Problem

RR's home win rate (40%) at Sawai Mansingh is the second-worst in the league after PBKS's Mohali (26.7%). This has persisted across multiple seasons and squad configurations, suggesting the venue itself is an away-team-friendly ground. RR's squad building should account for this by building a squad that wins away rather than optimizing for home conditions.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CHALLENGE**

The stat pack correctly flags the death bowling crisis and Jaiswal's powerplay value, but the Hetmyer-at-2 selection is not interrogated. The Jadeja trade analysis is thin. The home venue problem is stated but not connected to tactical implications.

---

### 6. Punjab Kings (PBKS)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.4/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 42.9% -> 35.7% -> 55.6% (ascending from low base)

#### Insight 1: Mohali's 26.7% Home Win Rate Is the Worst in IPL History (3-Season Window)

PBKS have won approximately 1 in 4 home games over the past three seasons. No other team is below 35%. This is not a small-sample anomaly; it covers roughly 15 home games. PBKS's squad has changed significantly across these seasons, yet the home record persists. This points to either a fundamental tactical mismatch with Mohali conditions or a psychological home-ground weakness.

**Coaching implication:** PBKS should stop building for Mohali conditions and instead build the strongest possible team regardless of venue. Their away record (which drove the 55.6% improvement in 2025) is where games are won.

#### Insight 2: Shreyas Iyer at 26.75 Cr Has a Powerplay Problem

Iyer is the second-most expensive player in the IPL at 26.75 Cr. He is captain and bats at 3 in the predicted XI with an "Elite top-order anchor" tag. But his powerplay SR is 112.72. For context, the league average powerplay SR for established top-order batters is roughly 135-140. Iyer is approximately 20-25 SR points below where a 26.75 Cr player should be in the first six overs. His value comes in the middle overs, but as captain-opener at 3, he faces powerplay bowling regularly.

**Coaching implication:** Iyer at 3 means PBKS are conceding powerplay momentum every time Iyer faces the new ball. Prabhsimran (1) and Priyansh Arya (2) need to absorb the strike in the powerplay and shield Iyer until over 7+. If either falls early, Iyer is exposed to the phase where his data is weakest.

#### Insight 3: Arshdeep's Trajectory Is the Best Pace Improvement in the Dataset

Arshdeep Singh: economy 9.2 -> 9.46 -> 8.62. In a league where most pace bowlers' economies increase with time (batters adapt, aging reduces pace), Arshdeep is moving against the trend. His 18 Cr price is justified by this trajectory. The predicted XI slots him at 9, and his "Franchise cornerstone" tag is data-supported.

**Coaching implication:** Arshdeep is PBKS's most important cricketer for 2026. His improvement buys them the death-phase reliability they have never had. Pair him with Jansen (all-rounder at 8) and Ferguson (pace at 11), and PBKS have a genuine three-pacer death attack for the first time.

#### Insight 4: Only Two Spinners in the Predicted XI Is a Structural Gamble

The predicted XI balance shows 2 spinners and 9 pacers. Chahal at 10 is the only specialist spinner. Stoinis and Shashank Singh provide part-time options, but neither is classified as a spinner. At Mohali (neutral venue bias), and across the IPL circuit where middle-overs spin is the primary control mechanism, carrying only one specialist spinner is a risk.

**Coaching implication:** PBKS may need to rotate Omarzai or use the impact player slot for an additional spinner in spin-friendly venues (Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad).

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

The stat pack covers Arshdeep's improvement and the Mohali home record well. The Iyer powerplay data is present but underweighted. The two-spinner structural risk is not addressed.

---

### 7. Delhi Capitals (DC)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.3/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 35.7% -> 50% -> 40% (stagnant)

#### Insight 1: Three Consecutive Non-Playoff Seasons Demand Root-Cause Analysis

DC have missed the playoffs for three straight seasons with win rates of 35.7%, 50%, and 40%. This is despite assembling squads with clear quality (Axar, KL Rahul, Kuldeep, Starc, Natarajan). The stat pack presents individual player data but does not connect it to team-level failure patterns. The depth chart's 7.3 rating is mid-table, which is consistent with the results but doesn't explain why individual quality isn't converting to collective performance.

**Coaching implication:** DC's problem is not talent. Their predicted XI has Starc (11.75 Cr) at 9, Natarajan (10.75 Cr) at 10, and Kuldeep (13.25 Cr) at 11. Three bowlers worth 35.75 Cr form the tail. The batting ends effectively at Miller (6) or Nitish Rana (8). DC have invested heavily in bowling and neglected middle-order depth.

#### Insight 2: Stubbs' SR Collapse Is Alarming

Tristan Stubbs: SR 185.3 -> 148.5 across two seasons. A 36.8-point SR decline for a player classified as "Finisher" at 10 Cr is structurally damaging. The predicted XI slots Stubbs at 5 as a finisher. If Stubbs continues his declining trajectory, DC have no middle-order enforcer. The depth chart notes DC's finisher position is overseas-dependent, and Stubbs occupies one of the four overseas slots.

**Coaching implication:** DC are paying 10 Cr for a declining finisher who takes an overseas slot. If Stubbs does not reverse his form in 2026, DC must consider Miller (2 Cr, also overseas) at 5 and using the freed overseas slot for bowling depth.

#### Insight 3: Kuldeep Yadav's Death Bowling Is a Hidden Weapon

Kuldeep at death: 7.58 economy. For a spinner, this is exceptional. Most spinners are not trusted at death, but Kuldeep's economy is lower than Harshal Patel's (9.78) and comparable to Noor Ahmad's (7.65). The predicted XI places Kuldeep at 11 (last bowler), but his death-phase data suggests he should be bowling overs 18-19, not just the middle-overs restriction that his spinner classification implies.

**Coaching implication:** DC should actively bowl Kuldeep at death. This is a structural advantage that most teams cannot replicate because they do not have a spinner with sub-8.0 death economy.

#### Insight 4: Axar Patel's Off-Spin Vulnerability as Captain-Batter

Axar Patel is captain. He bats left-handed and his specific batting vulnerability is off-spin (100 SR, 11 avg). A captain who averages 11 against off-spin is targetable. Axar bats in the middle order where off-spin is deployed as the primary control bowling type. This means opposition captains have a direct lever to suppress DC's captain's batting contribution.

**Coaching implication:** Axar's captaincy role means he cannot be hidden in the batting order. If he bats at 7, his off-spin vulnerability is limited by fewer balls faced. But if DC need him at 5-6, opponents can use off-spin to neutralize both his batting and his field-setting confidence.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

Good individual player data. The Kuldeep death-bowling insight is correctly surfaced. Stubbs' decline is noted. But the stat pack does not connect three seasons of underperformance to structural batting depth issues or Axar's dual vulnerability as captain-batter.

---

### 8. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.7/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 28.6% -> 56.2% -> 42.9% (volatile)

#### Insight 1: Klaasen vs CSK Is the Single Most Extreme Opposition Matchup in the Dataset

Heinrich Klaasen: career SR 175.22, but vs CSK: 96.83 SR. That is a 78.39-point SR differential. No other batter in the dataset has a higher SR gap against any single opposition. At 23 Cr (franchise cornerstone), Klaasen is SRH's most expensive player and their designated finisher at 6. In SRH vs CSK (expected 2+ fixtures), Klaasen's batting contribution essentially disappears.

**Coaching implication:** SRH should consider batting Klaasen deeper against CSK or managing his strike exposure against CSK's specific bowling combination (likely Noor Ahmad + Rahul Chahar at Chepauk). This is not a coaching intuition; it is a data-backed fixture-level adjustment.

#### Insight 2: Ishan Kishan's Dual Spin Vulnerability Is Unprecedented

Ishan Kishan vs off-spin: 104.72 SR. Ishan Kishan vs leg-spin: BPD 9.78. Having below-par numbers against both spin types is extremely rare for an IPL top-order batter. Kishan bats at 3 in the predicted XI as wicketkeeper. In the middle overs (where spin dominates), Kishan is structurally compromised against the two most common spin types simultaneously.

**Coaching implication:** SRH's middle overs will underperform whenever Kishan is on strike against spin. The mitigation is to ensure Head and Abhishek Sharma absorb the powerplay aggressively, so that Kishan arrives at the crease when pace returns at death. But if a top-order wicket falls early, Kishan is exposed to exactly the phase he cannot handle.

#### Insight 3: Travis Head's Decline Is Pace-Comparable to Dube's

Head: SR 184.7 -> 150.8 (est.) across two seasons. This is a 34-point decline, comparable to Stubbs' 36.8. Head at 14 Cr opens with a "Powerplay aggressor" tag. If Head's SR continues to compress, SRH's powerplay — built around Head + Abhishek Sharma as a left-hand/left-hand pairing — loses its identity. The predicted XI opens two left-handers, which also creates a tactical vulnerability against right-arm off-spin in the first over.

**Coaching implication:** Head's decline should be monitored through the first 3-4 games. If his SR in 2026 drops below 145, SRH must consider opening Livingstone or promoting Nitish Kumar Reddy.

#### Insight 4: Harshal Patel's Death Role Is Volume-Dependent

Harshal: 35 death wickets, 9.78 economy. He is the highest death-phase wicket-taker in the SRH squad by a significant margin. But 9.78 economy is expensive. Harshal's model is high-volume wickets at the cost of runs. At Rajiv Gandhi Stadium (pace-friendly, spin SR 26.6), Harshal's cutter-based bowling may be less effective than at slower surfaces.

**Coaching implication:** Harshal is effective but costly. SRH need a complementary death bowler to control economy while Harshal hunts wickets. The predicted XI does not include Cummins (captain), which means the death-phase pairing is Harshal + Mavi/Unadkat. Neither alternative is death-phase proven.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

The Klaasen-CSK matchup and Ishan Kishan dual vulnerability are correctly identified and analytically strong. Head's decline is noted but not contextualized. The predicted XI omitting Cummins from the playing XI is not addressed by the stat pack.

---

### 9. Gujarat Titans (GT)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.4/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 64.7% -> 41.7% -> 60% (resilient)

#### Insight 1: Prasidh Krishna's Death Over-Performance Is the Most Extreme in the Dataset

Prasidh Krishna: +29.5 death efficiency rating, 60% of death wickets from 30.5% of overs at death. This is the highest over-performance index for any death bowler in the league. Combined with Siraj and Rabada, GT have three quality pace bowlers with established death credentials. No other team has three bowlers with this profile simultaneously.

**Coaching implication:** GT's death bowling is their structural advantage. Rashid Khan's declining economy (8.21 -> 8.52 -> 9.34) in the middle overs is concerning, but the death-phase trio of Prasidh, Siraj, and Rabada can compensate by restricting in the last four overs.

#### Insight 2: Gill + Sai Sudharsan Is the Most Data-Proven Opening Partnership

Gill: 1966 career IPL runs. Sai Sudharsan: 1648 career IPL runs. Combined, they represent 3,614 runs from two players who have played together for GT. The depth chart rates GT's opener position at the highest level, and both bat in the predicted XI at 1 and 2 respectively. No other team has two openers with this volume of partnership data and complementary hand profiles (right-left combination).

**Coaching implication:** GT's batting identity is top-heavy by design. If Gill and Sudharsan provide a 50+ opening stand, GT's win probability increases dramatically because Buttler at 3 can accelerate from a stable base.

#### Insight 3: Rashid Khan's Economy Decline Is Real but Context-Dependent

Rashid's economy: 8.21 -> 8.52 -> 9.34. A 1.13-point increase over three seasons is significant for an 18 Cr franchise spinner. However, Rashid's role has evolved: he bowls more in the powerplay and death phases than a typical middle-overs spinner. His economy at death may be inflating his overall number. The stat pack does not break Rashid's economy by phase, which is a significant analytical gap.

**Coaching implication:** Rashid at 9.34 economy is still net-positive because of his wicket-taking ability. But if his economy crosses 10.0, GT must reconsider his over allocation. Washington Sundar and Glenn Phillips provide middle-overs spin alternatives, which may allow GT to protect Rashid's economy by bowling him in more favorable phases.

#### Insight 4: Smallest Squad in the League (20 Players) Creates Injury Risk

GT's 20-player squad is the smallest, tied with LSG. The depth chart specifically flags thin depth at All-rounder (Batting-first): 3.9 rating and All-rounder (Bowling-first): 4.1 rating. If GT lose one all-rounder to injury, their balance is fundamentally compromised. The predicted XI already has Prasidh Krishna listed at position 4 (unusual for a pace bowler), suggesting the algorithm struggled to find batting depth.

**Coaching implication:** GT should consider signing a replacement player before the season begins, or identify a multi-role utility player from their existing squad who can cover both batting and bowling shortfalls.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **APPROVE**

GT's stat pack correctly surfaces the Prasidh death numbers, the Gill-Sudharsan partnership data, and the squad size concern. The missing Rashid phase-specific economy data is a gap but not a fatal one. Clean, well-structured analysis.

### 10. Lucknow Super Giants (LSG)

**Depth Chart Rating:** 7.3/10 | **Season Trajectory:** 53.3% -> 50% -> 42.9% (declining)

#### Insight 1: Pant's Death-Phase SR Is Elite but His Spin Vulnerability Is Opposition-Specific

Rishabh Pant: death SR 203.25. This is one of the highest in the league for designated finishers. But Pant vs LA wrist spin: 100 SR. The gap between 203.25 and 100 is the widest phase-vs-type differential for any single player. Pant at 27 Cr (most expensive player in IPL history) bats at 5 in the predicted XI. If Pant arrives at the crease during the middle overs against LA wrist spin (Rashid Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Noor Ahmad), his contribution is capped. If he bats at death against pace, he is devastating.

**Coaching implication:** LSG's batting strategy must ensure Pant faces death-phase bowling, not middle-overs spin. This means the top 4 (Marsh, Markram, Digvesh Rathi, Himmat Singh) must occupy overs 7-15. The predicted XI's top 4 is unusually weak by name recognition, which may be by design: sacrificial middle-overs batters to protect Pant's arrival at death.

#### Insight 2: Pooran's SR Acceleration Is the Best in the League

Nicholas Pooran: SR 165 -> 168.6 -> 180.7. No other batter in the dataset is accelerating at this rate across three seasons. Pooran at 6 in the predicted XI with a "Powerplay aggressor" tag (contradicting his No. 6 position) is slotted as wicketkeeper. The combination of Pant (5) and Pooran (6) gives LSG the most destructive 5-6 batting pair in the league by current SR data.

**Coaching implication:** If Pant and Pooran bat together at death, LSG's batting output in overs 16-20 will be among the league's best. The risk is that the top 4 is weak enough that Pant arrives at the crease too early (overs 8-10), pulling him into the spin-vulnerable middle phase.

#### Insight 3: Mayank Yadav Is Not in the Predicted XI, and That Is a Data Gap

Mayank Yadav (not listed in the predicted XI) is one of the most talked-about young fast bowlers, but the SUPER SELECTOR operates on historical IPL data. Mayank's limited sample size means he was not selected algorithmically. The stat pack notes his presence in the squad but provides no phase-specific data. This is a case where the algorithmic approach misses a player whose ceiling exceeds his dataset footprint.

**Coaching implication:** LSG's actual XI will likely include Mayank Yadav. The predicted XI should be read as "the best XI based on available data" rather than "the best XI overall." Shami (9), Avesh (10), and Mohsin (11) form the predicted pace attack, but Mayank may replace one of them.

#### Insight 4: Avesh Khan's Death Economy Is Unsustainable

Avesh Khan: death economy 9.67. For a bowler positioned at 10 in the XI, this is expensive. LSG's depth chart notes no overseas dependency at the death pacer position, meaning Avesh is the go-to domestic death option. But 9.67 economy at death, paired with Harshal-comparable volume without Harshal's wicket-taking rate, makes Avesh a run-conceding option rather than a match-winning one.

**Coaching implication:** LSG need Shami or Mayank Yadav to bowl at death. Avesh should be restricted to the powerplay and middle overs, where his economy is more manageable.

#### Stat Pack Tactical Section Rating: **CAVEAT**

Pant's death SR and Pooran's acceleration are correctly identified. The Pant spin vulnerability is surfaced. But the Mayank Yadav omission from the predicted XI is not flagged as a data limitation, and Avesh's death economy is noted without tactical recommendation.

## Part 2: Cross-Team Patterns (League-Wide)

### Pattern 1: The Death Bowling Aristocracy

Only four teams have a death bowler with sub-8.0 economy: MI (Bumrah, 6.75), CSK (Noor Ahmad, 7.65), DC (Kuldeep, 7.58), and the boundary case of Pathirana (8.65, but massive wicket volume). Every other team's death phase is a vulnerability. This creates a clear competitive bifurcation: teams with elite death bowlers can defend totals; teams without cannot. The league-wide death economy average sits above 9.5, meaning any bowler below 8.5 is a structural advantage.

### Pattern 2: Spin Vulnerabilities Are Pervasive and Undertargeted

Across all 10 stat packs, I count 14+ individual batters with specific spin-type vulnerabilities (SR < 110 or Avg < 12 against a specific spin classification). These include: Dhoni (LA orthodox), QdK (off-spin), Krunal (off-spin), Rinku (off-spin), Kishan (off-spin AND leg-spin), Narine vs MI, Axar (off-spin), Pant (LA wrist spin), Livingstone (LA orthodox), and others. The density of spin vulnerabilities suggests that teams investing in multi-type spin attacks (e.g., carrying both off-spin and LA wrist spin) have a structural scouting advantage.

### Pattern 3: Home Venue Advantage Is Not What Fans Think

League-wide home win rates by venue reveal that several traditional "home grounds" are actually disadvantageous:
- Mohali (PBKS): 26.7%
- Arun Jaitley (DC): 35.3%
- Sawai Mansingh (RR): 40%
- Chinnaswamy (RCB): 47.4%

Four of ten teams have home win rates below 50%. This contradicts the popular narrative that home advantage is a given in the IPL. The teams with above-50% home records (Chepauk, Wankhede, Eden Gardens, etc.) tend to have spin-biased or pace-biased venue profiles that their squads are built to exploit. The underperforming teams have neutral-classified venues or squad compositions that do not match their venue's bias.

### Pattern 4: The 25+ Cr Player Has Not Proven Worth Yet

Three players in the 2026 season cost 25 Cr or above: Pant (27 Cr), Iyer (26.75 Cr), Green (25.2 Cr). Each has a data-backed concern:
- Pant: LA wrist spin vulnerability limits middle-overs value
- Iyer: 112.72 powerplay SR underperforms his price bracket
- Green: Takes one overseas slot on the lowest-depth squad

These are not failures; they are structural risks that the price premium was supposed to buy past. The data does not yet show that any of these three players deliver value proportional to their cost relative to players in the 14-18 Cr bracket (Bumrah, Jaiswal, Arshdeep, Chahal).

### Pattern 5: Season-Over-Season Volatility Is the Norm, Not the Exception

Six of ten teams show win-rate swings of 15+ percentage points between consecutive seasons: MI (28.6% to 56.2%), KKR (78.6% to 38.5%), RR (60% to 28.6%), PBKS (35.7% to 55.6%), SRH (28.6% to 56.2%), GT (41.7% to 60%). This level of volatility suggests that IPL team performance is heavily influenced by factors outside squad composition: injuries, fixture scheduling, toss luck, and the stochastic nature of T20 cricket. Any tactical analysis (including this one) should be read with the understanding that T20 variance is high and sample sizes are small.

## Part 3: Novel Insights (Phil Steele Rule)

*The Phil Steele Rule: every insight must answer a question the average fan doesn't know how to ask yet.*

### Novel Insight 1: "Who Benefits Most From the Impact Player Rule?"

The impact player substitution allows a team to bring on a 12th player as a specialist batter or bowler. The data shows that teams with constraint violations in their predicted XI (RCB) or thin all-rounder depth (GT, KKR) benefit disproportionately from this rule. RCB's predicted XI has only 3 primary bowling options; the impact player slot is their mechanism to add a 4th bowler. GT's thin all-rounder depth means the impact slot functions as a structural repair tool.

The question fans should be asking is not "who is the best impact player?" but "which teams *need* the impact player slot to make their XI functional?"

### Novel Insight 2: "When Does Strike Rate Decline Signal Career Risk vs. Phase Adjustment?"

Dube (152.9 -> 123.5), Stubbs (185.3 -> 148.5), Head (184.7 -> 150.8), and Dhoni (196.3 -> 127.3) all show multi-season SR declines. But the causes differ: Dhoni's is age-driven (reaction time vs spin), Dube's is phase-specific (death phase compression), Head's may be adjustment-related (opponents changing their plans), and Stubbs' is unknown (insufficient phase data). Fans see declining SR and assume the same thing. The data says there are at least four distinct mechanisms behind SR decline, and each requires a different coaching response.

### Novel Insight 3: "Which Team's Depth Chart Is Most Accurately Reflected in Their Results?"

GT (7.4 depth rating, 60% win rate) and MI (8.6 depth rating, 56.2% win rate) have the best alignment between depth chart quality and on-field results. KKR (6.9 depth rating, 38.5% win rate) and DC (7.3 depth rating, 40% win rate) also align, but at the underperforming end. The outliers are RCB (8.1 depth rating, 73.3% win rate) and RR (7.4 depth rating, 28.6% win rate). RCB massively outperformed their depth, and RR massively underperformed. These outliers are the teams most likely to regress to their depth chart ratings in 2026.

### Novel Insight 4: "Which Bowling Type Has the Highest Exploitable Gap Across the League?"

Off-spin is the single most common batting vulnerability type across all 10 stat packs. QdK (109.52 SR), Krunal (67.35 SR), Rinku (85.96 SR), Axar (100 SR), Ishan Kishan (104.72 SR) are all documented off-spin vulnerabilities. Teams with quality off-spinners (R Ashwin-type bowlers are absent, but Sundar, Krunal, Varun, and various part-timers exist) can systematically target 5+ batters across the league. The question fans don't ask is: "Does my team have an off-spinner good enough to exploit the league's most common batting weakness?"

### Novel Insight 5: "What Is the True Cost of an Overseas Slot?"

Across all 10 teams, the average overseas player costs 8.2 Cr. But the depth chart reveals that for 7 of 10 teams, at least one critical position is "overseas dependent." KKR's dependency is the most extreme: Opener (Narine), No.3 (Green as backup), and Wicketkeeper (Finn Allen) are all overseas-dependent. This means KKR effectively have only 1 flexible overseas slot. The cost of an overseas slot is not the player's price; it is the opportunity cost of every other overseas player who cannot be selected. Green's 25.2 Cr is really 25.2 Cr plus the value of whatever overseas death bowler or finisher KKR cannot field because Green occupies a slot.

## Closing Note

This review is built on ball-by-ball data, not opinion. Where the data is insufficient (Mayank Yadav's limited IPL sample, Rashid Khan's phase-specific economy breakdown, several new auction recruits without IPL history), I have noted the gap rather than speculated. The stat packs produced by the analytics engine are, overall, high quality. Two teams (KKR, RR) received CHALLENGE ratings not because their data is wrong, but because the analytical framework does not connect individual data points to team-level performance patterns. The remaining eight stat packs are sound, with caveats noted.

Every insight in this document can be verified against the source stat packs in `/stat_packs/{TEAM}/{TEAM}_stat_pack.md` and the predicted XII in `/outputs/predicted_xii/predicted_xii_2026.json`.
