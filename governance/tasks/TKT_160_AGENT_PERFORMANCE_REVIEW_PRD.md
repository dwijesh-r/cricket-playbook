# Task PRD: TKT-160 — Agent Performance Review & Skills Radar

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Requester:** Founder
**Assigned To:** Brad Stevens (Architecture & Performance Lead)
**Epic:** EPIC-003 (Phase 1: Governance Setup)

---

## Problem Statement

We are mid-sprint (Sprint 4.0 at 63% completion) with 14 agents and the Founder operating the system. There has been no formal performance review or skills audit since the roster was established. Without this, we risk:
- Agents operating with undefined or overlapping skill gaps
- Under-utilization of high-performing agents
- Missing capabilities that could be filled by retraining or adding agents
- No baseline for tracking agent improvement over time

## Proposed Solution

Brad Stevens conducts a comprehensive performance review covering:

1. **Individual Agent Ratings (1-5 scale)** for all 14 agents + Founder
2. **Skills Radar** mapping each agent's strengths and weaknesses
3. **Utilization Assessment** — who is overloaded, who is underutilized
4. **Gap Analysis** — what capabilities are missing from the roster
5. **Recommendations** — retrain existing agents, expand mandates, or propose new agents
6. **Founder Rating** — rate the Founder as if they were an agent (objectivity matters)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 14 agents + Founder rated on 1-5 scale with justification
- [ ] Skills radar document produced with strength/weakness mapping
- [ ] Concrete recommendations for retraining or new agent proposals
- [ ] Document archived in `reviews/` directory
- [ ] Task Integrity Loop fully completed with all sign-offs

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Performance ratings based on Sprint 4.0 outputs and historical contributions
- Skills/weakness mapping per agent
- Gap analysis and roster recommendations
- Founder assessment

**Out of scope:**
- Actual agent retraining (separate tickets)
- New agent creation (requires Founder approval per Constitution)
- Changes to Constitution or authority hierarchy

## Dependencies

- Access to Mission Control ticket data (completed work per agent)
- Access to agent persona files (`config/agents/`)
- Access to sprint deliverables and outputs

## Estimated Effort

Medium (single document deliverable, research-heavy)
