## The Headline

**The Bowling-First Revolution Is Real. Now Comes the Hard Part.**

For a decade, watching RCB bowl was like watching someone parallel park a bus. Entertaining, occasionally heroic, but mostly just painful. That changed in 2025. The franchise that once treated bowling as something that happened between batting collapses posted a 73.3% win rate, won their maiden IPL title, and did it with a powerplay bowling attack that conceded over a run per over fewer than the league average. The question for 2026 isn't whether RCB can bat. It's whether a franchise built on vibes and Kohli can defend a title built on discipline.

---

## The Story

The 2025 season wasn't just the most significant in RCB's 18-year history because of the trophy. It was significant because of *how* that trophy was won. After the mega auction stripped the squad to its studs (only Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal survived from 2024), RCB did something nobody expected: they became boring. Gloriously, effectively, championship-winningly boring.

Josh Hazlewood (12.50 Cr, retained) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (10.75 Cr, retained) turned the powerplay into a graveyard for opening batters. Hazlewood at 7.54 economy, Bhuvneshwar at 8.26 across their IPL careers since 2023. The team's powerplay bowling economy dropped from 9.77 in 2024 to 8.73 in 2025, a transformation of over a run per over. For the first time in franchise history, the opening pair with the ball was doing what the opening pair with the bat had always done: setting the terms of engagement.

The middle overs belonged to Krunal Pandya (5.75 Cr, retained). Think of him as the midfield anchor in a football team, the guy who never makes the highlight reel but whose absence turns the whole system into chaos. His 7.45 middle-overs economy across 82 overs gave RCB something they'd never had before: a phase of controlled, suffocating pressure. Opponents couldn't recover from Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar starts because Krunal refused to let them breathe.

The death overs revealed a different animal entirely: Tim David (3.00 Cr, retained) at 184.6 SR across 286 balls at the death, with Jitesh Sharma (11.00 Cr, retained) at 191.6 SR across 178 balls alongside him. The team that once needed Kohli to anchor every chase now has designated finishers who can close out an innings without needing an anchor at all. The result: RCB beat Punjab Kings by 6 runs in the Final to claim their maiden IPL crown.

For 2026, the title-winning core returns largely intact, with 15 players retained. Six auction purchases, headlined by Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr), shore up the batting depth. The question marks are specific and unavoidable. Can Yash Dayal's off-field situation be resolved? Can the spin depth survive if opponents target the off-spin gap? And can the middle order shoulder more of the load now that the defending champions have a target painted on their backs?

---

## Off-Season Changes

**Captaincy:** Rajat Patidar stays on as captain after leading RCB to the promised land in 2025. His batting position at number 4 gives him a tactical vantage point, and winning a title tends to silence any dressing-room debate about authority. The continuity matters here: no leadership disruption heading into a title defence.

**Key Departures (from 2025 squad):** Liam Livingstone (to SRH), Lungi Ngidi (to DC), MA Agarwal, and MS Bhandage. Livingstone's departure removes a power-hitting overseas swiss army knife who could bat anywhere from 3 to 6. But Ngidi's exit stings more. He was Hazlewood's partner in crime, the second overseas seamer who brought genuine pace and bounce. Losing him is like a restaurant losing its sous chef: the head chef is still there, but the kitchen runs thinner.

**Key Retentions:** RCB kept 15 players from the championship squad, anchored by Kohli (21.00 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), Salt (11.50 Cr), Patidar (11.00 Cr), and Jitesh Sharma (11.00 Cr). The retention strategy was clear: protect the championship core at premium prices and trust that the system, not individual upgrades, would carry forward.

**Auction Strategy:** The auction tells a two-tier story. At the top: Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr) and Romario Shepherd (2.00 Cr, re-acquired after playing for RCB in 2025) represent direct playing XII impact — Iyer fills the Maxwell-shaped hole at #3 and Shepherd returns as the designated death-overs chaos agent. Below them: Kanishk Chouhan (0.30 Cr, uncapped off-spin all-rounder), Duffy (0.75 Cr), Deswal (0.30 Cr), Mangesh Yadav (0.30 Cr), and Jordan Cox (0.30 Cr) are all depth buys — insurance policies, not starting XI disruptors. The message was clear: keep the band together, fill the gaps cheap, and trust the system.

**What's Structurally Different from 2025:** The overseas pace equation has shifted. RCB went from two premium overseas quicks (Hazlewood + Ngidi) to one, and swapped Livingstone's batting utility for Venkatesh Iyer's Indian all-rounder profile. This frees overseas slot flexibility (David, Bethell, Shepherd, or Duffy can rotate as the fourth overseas player) but makes the bowling attack more reliant on Indian seamers (Bhuvneshwar, Yash Dayal, Mangesh Yadav) to complement Hazlewood. It's a calculated bet: more batting options, less bowling insurance.

---

## Auction Strategy: The Thinking Behind the Buys

RCB's auction spent 10.65 Cr across seven purchases. The strategy splits cleanly into two tiers: one player who changes the starting XI, and six who deepen the bench without disrupting the championship formula.

### Direct XII Impact

**Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr)** is the only auction buy that alters the playing XI. He fills the left-handed all-rounder slot at #3 that's been vacant since Maxwell's departure — a batter who can stabilize or accelerate depending on the situation, and chip in with part-time seam if the bowling mix needs flexibility. His 149.9 SR and 31.6 average across 34 IPL innings since 2023 (HIGH sample) is genuine middle-order substance. The concern: 96.9 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 32 balls) and 75.0 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 16 balls). Limited data, but flags worth watching.

### Depth Buys: Insurance, Not Disruption

The remaining six purchases total 3.65 Cr — bargain-bin reinforcements covering specific scenarios:

| Buy | Price | Role in Squad | XII Impact vs Depth |
|-----|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Romario Shepherd (WI) | 2.00 Cr | Death-overs hitter + pace AR. Played for RCB in 2025, knows the system | **Rotation XII** — competes for 4th overseas slot with Bethell/Duffy |
| Jacob Duffy (NZ) | 0.75 Cr | Overseas pace backup behind Hazlewood | **Pure depth** — plays only if Hazlewood is unavailable |
| Kanishk Chouhan (IND) | 0.30 Cr | Uncapped off-spin all-rounder, 19 years old | **Development** — addresses off-spin gap on paper; may not play at all |
| Satvik Deswal (IND) | 0.30 Cr | Left-arm wrist-spinner, 18 years old | **Development** — bonus variation, not a necessity given Suyash covers leg-spin |
| Mangesh Yadav (IND) | 0.30 Cr | Left-arm fast, 6 IPL matches, 9 wkts at 9.32 econ | **Depth with upside** — could become relevant if Yash Dayal is unavailable |
| Jordan Cox (ENG) | 0.30 Cr | Backup keeper behind Salt and Jitesh | **Pure depth** — emergency insurance only |

**What the Auction Tells You:** RCB believe the championship was won by a system, not by individual talent. The auction reinforces that system rather than attempting to upgrade it. Only Iyer represents a genuine upgrade to the XI. Everyone else is a contingency plan. This is a franchise that has learned the hardest lesson in professional sport: when something works, don't fix it — just make sure you can survive when parts of it break.

## Team Style Analysis

If you showed someone RCB's 2024 numbers next to their 2025 numbers without telling them which team it was, they'd assume these were two completely different franchises. And they'd basically be right.

**2024: Still Living in the Past**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 156.9 | 9.77 |
| Middle | 146.9 | 9.53 |
| Death | 195.9 | 10.90 |

In 2024, RCB played like a team trying to outscore a house fire. A 195.9 death SR was eye-popping, but the bowling was forgettable: 9.77 in the powerplay, 10.90 at the death. The squad was built around batting firepower (Kohli, du Plessis, Maxwell, Patidar) with bowling essentially playing the role of "please don't lose it too badly."

**2025: Somebody Read the Memo**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy | Delta from 2024 |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 154.1 | 8.73 | Bat: -2.8 / Bowl: -1.04 |
| Middle | 143.9 | 8.89 | Bat: -3.0 / Bowl: -0.64 |
| Death | 180.8 | 10.75 | Bat: -15.1 / Bowl: -0.15 |

Look at those bowling numbers. Powerplay economy improved by a full run per over. Middle-overs economy dropped from 9.53 to 8.89. Yes, batting strike rates came down across every phase (especially at the death, from 195.9 to 180.8), but that's the point. RCB stopped trying to win shootouts and started winning chess matches.

**Squad-Building Philosophy:** RCB has gone from stacking batting talent like it's going out of fashion to investing in bowling infrastructure. The retention of Bhuvneshwar (10.75 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), and Krunal (5.75 Cr), three of the four priciest bowler retentions, tells you everything. They're top-heavy with the bat (Kohli + Salt own the powerplay; David + Jitesh own the death), lean in the middle order, and deep with bowling options. Five all-rounders (Venkatesh Iyer, Krunal, Shepherd, Bethell, Swapnil Singh) suggest a belief in flexibility over specialization. This is a franchise that has finally learned what every successful team already knows: you can't buy a title with batters alone. Someone has to actually get the other lot out.

## Category Ratings

### Phase Performance

| Category | Rating | Key Metric (2025) | Context |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Batting, Powerplay** | 6.5/10 | 154.1 SR | Above average, but it's basically a Salt solo show |
| **Batting, Middle** | 6.0/10 | 143.9 SR | League-average. This is where the engine sputters |
| **Batting, Death** | 8.0/10 | 180.8 SR | Elite trio of David (184.6), Jitesh (191.6), Kohli (183.3) |
| **Bowling, Powerplay** | 8.5/10 | 8.73 econ | Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar is a cheat code |
| **Bowling, Middle** | 7.5/10 | 8.89 econ | Krunal's 7.45 econ is the secret ingredient |
| **Bowling, Death** | 5.5/10 | 10.75 econ | Yash Dayal's status makes this worse; Bhuvneshwar at 10.96 is not death bowling |

### Squad Structure

| Category | Rating | Key Metric | Context |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Squad Depth** | 5.5/10 | 25 players, ~5 viable bench options | Off-spin depth 1.4/10. Padikkal showing form (151.5 L10 SR, rebounding); Bethell has limited IPL exposure. One injury to Bhuvneshwar and there is no like-for-like replacement |
| **XII Completeness** | 6.5/10 | 5 of 7 key roles filled | Openers, middle order, finishers, PP pace, middle-overs spin all covered. Leg-spin covered by Suyash Sharma. Missing: frontline off-spinner and dedicated death specialist. Yash Dayal's availability is a question mark |
| **Batting Variety** | 6.0/10 | 1 LHB in top 7 (V Iyer) | Dominate pace (+8.7 to +9.6 vs league) but underperform vs off-spin (-1.5). Right-hand dominant lineup lets opposition plan one-dimensionally |
| **Bowling Variety** | 5.5/10 | 4 bowling types in XII | Leg-spin covered (Suyash Sharma), no frontline off-spin, only 1 left-arm option (Krunal). If Dayal unavailable, zero left-arm pace. Off-spin is the genuine gap |
| **Experience** | 7.5/10 | 6 of XII have 50+ IPL caps | Kohli (240+), Bhuvneshwar (180+), Krunal (100+), Hazlewood (50+) provide tournament pedigree. Youth (Suyash 26 caps, Shepherd 12) adds energy. Rare balance of know-how and hunger |

### Overall

| Category | Rating | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Overall** | **6.9/10** | Phase performance (avg 7.0) offset by structural gaps in depth and XII completeness. Sharp peaks (PP bowling 8.5, death batting 8.0) mask uncomfortable valleys (squad depth 5.5). A team built to win Plan A games; the question is what happens when Plan A gets shut down. |

The expanded profile reveals something the phase-only ratings hide: RCB are structurally narrow. The phase performance averages 7.0, which is genuinely strong. But the squad structure averages 6.2. The gap between those two numbers is the distance between a team that performs well in ideal conditions and one that can adapt when conditions turn hostile. Suyash Sharma's leg-spin gives them one variation axis, and Krunal's left-arm orthodox gives them another. But the off-spin gap remains the genuine structural hole. Every championship defence involves at least 3-4 matches where Plan A fails. RCB's structural ratings suggest they have fewer fallback options than a defending champion should.

## Team Batting Profile: How RCB Handle Different Bowling

The squad-building section told you *what* RCB are. This section tells you where they score freely and where they get stuck.

### vs. Bowling Types (Since 2023)

| Bowling Type | RCB SR | League Avg SR | Diff | Verdict |
|-------------|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| Right-arm pace | 153.6 | 144.9 | +8.7 | Dominant. This is where the lineup does its best work |
| Left-arm pace | 156.4 | 146.8 | +9.6 | Even better. Angle variation makes no difference |
| Leg-spin | 144.5 | 141.1 | +3.4 | Comfortable. Patidar's 225.0 SR vs leggies does heavy lifting |
| Left-arm wrist-spin | 131.1 | 124.7 | +6.4 | Above average, but the small sample deserves caution |
| Left-arm orthodox | 138.7 | 138.3 | +0.4 | Dead average. Nothing notable |
| Off-spin | 130.8 | 132.3 | -1.5 | Below average. The only bowling type where RCB underperform |

The story is straightforward. RCB dominate pace bowling. Right-arm, left-arm, the result is the same. The squad is built around players who score quickly against seam, and the numbers confirm it: +8.7 SR against right-arm pace and +9.6 against left-arm pace versus the league. Salt, Kohli, Patidar, and David are all natural pace-hitters, and the combined effect is a lineup that consistently accelerates against anything over 130 kph.

The vulnerability is off-spin. RCB are 1.5 SR points *below* the league average against off-spinners, the only bowling type where they underperform. It's a small deficit, but it rhymes perfectly with the 1.4/10 off-spin depth chart rating on the bowling side. This is a squad that neither bowls off-spin effectively nor bats against it particularly well. It's like a football club with no left foot: you can work around it, but smart opponents will make you pay.

### Phase-Wise Batting (Since 2023)

| Phase | RCB SR | League SR | Diff | Boundary % (RCB / League) | Dot % (RCB / League) |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Powerplay | 150.2 | 140.6 | +9.6 | 24.6% / 23.3% | 36.9% / 40.5% |
| Middle | 138.8 | 135.4 | +3.4 | 16.1% / 16.2% | 26.0% / 28.3% |
| Death | 162.8 | 158.8 | +4.0 | 23.4% / 21.8% | 26.4% / 26.2% |

The powerplay is where RCB separate themselves. A +9.6 SR differential over the league, plus a dot ball rate 3.6 percentage points below average (36.9% vs 40.5%). Translation: RCB batters find gaps more often than any other team in the first six overs. Salt's 177.5 SR is the obvious engine, but Kohli's ability to rotate strike and let Salt take the risks makes this a two-man partnership that's greater than the sum of its parts.

Middle overs are adequate but not elite. The +3.4 SR gap narrows considerably here, and the boundary rate (16.1%) is almost identical to the league (16.2%). This is where Krunal's batting contribution (124.4 recent form SR; career 121.1) and Patidar's form slump create a drag. The saving grace: a dot ball rate of 26.0% (vs 28.3% league), meaning they rotate well even when boundaries dry up. Busy, not brutal.

Death overs are strong (+4.0 SR) with a notably higher boundary rate (23.4% vs 21.8%). David, Jitesh, and late-innings Kohli combine to produce a three-pronged death assault that most teams simply can't match for depth.

### Where the Two Stories Collide: Phase x Bowling Type

| Scenario | RCB SR | Sample | Confidence | Context |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|---------|
| Powerplay vs. RA pace | 160.0 | 785 balls | HIGH | Salt and Kohli destroying the most common new-ball attack |
| Death vs. LA pace | 181.5 | 233 balls | HIGH | David and Jitesh dismantling left-arm death bowling at will |
| Middle vs. off-spin | 128.3 | 329 balls | HIGH | 18 wickets lost. This is where campaigns get derailed |
| Middle vs. LA wrist-spin | 123.8 | 202 balls | HIGH | 11 wickets lost. The slower it gets, the less comfortable they look |

This cross-reference is where the scouting report gets really interesting. RCB's powerplay batting against right-arm pace (160.0 SR) is frankly ridiculous. It's the single most dominant batting scenario for this squad, and it explains why teams that open with pace at the Chinnaswamy often find themselves staring at 55-60 after six overs.

But flip to the middle overs against off-spin: 128.3 SR and 18 wickets. That's not a soft spot; that's a trapdoor. Teams like KKR (Narine + Varun) and CSK (who always seem to have an off-spinner up their sleeve) have the toolkit to exploit this phase specifically. Add middle-overs wrist-spin (123.8 SR, 11 wickets) and you see the pattern: if you can slow RCB down between overs 7-15 with spin, their batting advantage evaporates.

The tactical implication is clear. Opposition captains should bowl pace in the powerplay (and accept the damage), then stack spin between overs 7-15. That's the window where RCB look mortal. If they survive the middle-overs spin squeeze, their death batting takes over and the game is usually done. The battle for the IPL against RCB in 2026 will be won or lost in overs 7-15.

---

## Innings Context: Setting vs Chasing

This might be the most important section in the entire preview, because it reveals something the phase-by-phase numbers don't: RCB are two entirely different teams depending on whether they bat first or second.

### The Big Picture (Since 2023)

| Scenario | Matches | Wins | Win % |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| Batting first (setting) | 26 | 14 | 53.8% |
| Batting second (chasing) | 18 | 11 | 61.1% |

*Note: 44 total matches (26 setting, 18 chasing) is a moderate sample. Win% differences should be read as directional indicators, not definitive splits.*

That 7.3 percentage point gap is meaningful on its own. But the 2025 season makes it dramatic: RCB won 85.7% of their chases (6/7). Five of those were won with overs to spare.

### Team Batting: Two Different Gears

| Phase | Setting SR | Chasing SR | Delta | League Chase SR | RCB vs League |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Powerplay | 139.7 | 165.2 | +25.5 | 141.7 | **+23.5** |
| Middle | 134.5 | 145.4 | +10.9 | 137.2 | +8.2 |
| Death | 162.8 | 162.8 | 0.0 | 151.3 | +11.5 |
| **Overall** | **143.2** | **155.2** | **+12.0** | **141.5** | **+13.7** |

When setting a total, RCB bat at 143.2 SR. That's dead-on the league average of 143.1. Unremarkable. But when chasing, they jump to 155.2 SR, a full 13.7 points above the league average of 141.5. That's not a modest preference. That's a structural advantage.

The powerplay is where the transformation is most extreme. Setting: 139.7 SR, actually below league average. Chasing: 165.2 SR, some 23.5 points above the league. The explanation is straightforward: Salt and Kohli know the target. Salt, in particular, shifts from aggressive-but-calculated to outright assault mode when a scoreboard pressure exists to chase. His 174.5 chase SR (vs 162.2 setting) confirms this isn't team-level noise; it's Salt being given license to attack.

The death overs are identical (162.8 in both innings), which tells you David and Jitesh hit the same way regardless of context. That's a sign of genuine finishers, players whose approach doesn't change based on whether they're building or chasing. The difference is that in chases, RCB tend to arrive at the death in better positions because of the powerplay acceleration.

### Team Bowling: Better With Something to Defend

| Phase | Bowl First Econ | Defend Econ | Delta | Defend Dot% | Defend Wkt Rate |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Powerplay | 8.49 | 8.53 | +0.04 | 43.8% | 5.8% |
| Middle | 8.91 | 9.13 | +0.22 | 27.9% | 4.5% |
| Death | 10.71 | 9.44 | **-1.27** | 29.5% | 8.4% |
| **Overall** | **9.23** | **9.00** | **-0.23** | **33.4%** | **5.7%** |

The powerplay and middle-overs bowling is roughly similar regardless of innings. But look at the death overs: 9.44 economy defending vs 10.71 bowling first. That's a 1.27-run improvement. When RCB have a total on the board, their death bowlers concede fewer boundaries (20.0% vs 24.2%) and generate significantly more dot balls (29.5% vs 23.3%). They also take 50 wickets in 99 overs defending at death, compared to 36 in 92 overs bowling first. The pressure of a scoreboard target makes their death bowling visibly more effective.

### Individual Player Splits

**Batters:**

| Player | Setting SR | Chasing SR | Delta | Sample (Balls) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Virat Kohli | 137.6 | 147.8 | +10.2 | 835 / 601 (HIGH) |
| Phil Salt | 162.2 | 174.5 | +12.3 | 251 / 372 (MEDIUM) |
| Rajat Patidar | 154.7 | 149.3 | -5.4 | 322 / 140 (MEDIUM / LOW) |
| Tim David (career) | 143.1 | 166.8 | +23.7 | 246 / 184 (MEDIUM) |
| Jitesh Sharma (career) | 145.6 | 155.6 | +10.0 | 318 / 189 (MEDIUM) |
| Venkatesh Iyer | 144.6 | 144.9 | +0.3 | 332 / 301 (HIGH) |

Kohli is 10.2 SR points better chasing. The man who's spent two decades being described as the greatest chaser in cricket history still, at 37, demonstrably bats better with a target in front of him. Old habits, apparently.

Salt's +12.3 chase uplift makes the Kohli-Salt opening partnership particularly dangerous in the second innings. Both batters elevate their games when the equation is clear.

Tim David's career split is the standout: 166.8 chasing vs 143.1 setting, a 23.7-point gap. That's a player whose entire value proposition shifts depending on when he walks in. In a chase at the death, he's elite. Setting a total in the middle overs, he's ordinary.

Venkatesh Iyer is the exception: virtually no split difference (+0.3). He's the same batter regardless of context, which is actually useful for a number 3 who needs to be reliable in both scenarios.

Patidar bats marginally better when setting, but the chasing sample (140 balls) is too small to draw conclusions.

**Bowlers:**

| Bowler | Bowl First Econ | Defend Econ | Delta | Sample (Overs) |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Josh Hazlewood | 7.91 | 8.85 | +0.94 | 17 / 36 (LOW / MEDIUM) |
| Krunal Pandya | 7.36 | 8.75 | +1.39 | 24 / 24 (MEDIUM) |
| Suyash Sharma | 9.11 | 8.52 | -0.59 | 46 / 49 (MEDIUM) |
| Yash Dayal | 9.17 | 9.54 | +0.37 | 56 / 63 (MEDIUM) |
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | 8.98 | 9.44 | +0.46 | 23 / 31 (MEDIUM) |

Krunal's split is the most striking: 7.36 economy bowling first vs 8.75 defending, a 1.39-run gap. When RCB bowl first, Krunal is nearly untouchable in the middle overs. When defending, opponents bat more freely against him, likely because the scoreboard pressure is reversed. This is a significant tactical consideration for toss decisions.

Hazlewood shows a similar pattern (7.91 vs 8.85), though his bowling-first sample is small (17 overs). Suyash Sharma is the only bowler who's *better* defending (8.52 vs 9.11, 46/49 overs split — MEDIUM sample both sides), possibly because his leg-spin creates more pressure when opponents are chasing.

### The Chase Approach: Anatomy of a Run Down

RCB have chased 18 times since 2023. Their overall record (11/18, 61.1%) flatters them slightly, because it hides a dramatic cliff at the 180-run mark.

**Chase Results by Target Band (Since 2023)**

| Target Band | Chases | Wins | Win% | League Win% | RCB vs League |
|-------------|--------|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| ≤140 | 1 | 1 | 100.0% | 75.0% | +25.0 |
| 141-160 | 2 | 2 | 100.0% | 87.0% | +13.0 |
| 161-180 | 5 | 5 | 100.0% | 61.4% | **+38.6** |
| 181-200 | 4 | 2 | 50.0% | 44.2% | +5.8 |
| 200+ | 6 | 1 | 16.7% | 23.6% | -6.9 |

Eight chases of 180 or below. Eight wins. Zero failures. The 161-180 band is where the differential is sharpest: RCB win 100% where the league average is 61.4%, a 38.6 percentage-point gap. Above 180, the picture inverts. The 200+ record (1/6, 16.7%) is below league average.

The conclusion is unavoidable: RCB are elite at chasing achievable targets but crumble when asked to go beyond their natural run rate. The bowling needs to keep targets below 180 for the batting to function at full capacity.

**How the Approach Changes by Target Size**

| Target Band | PP SR | PP Wkts/Match | Mid SR | Mid Wkts/Match | Death SR | Death Wkts/Match |
|-------------|-------|---------------|--------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| ≤160 | 11.50 | 1.00 | 8.37 | 2.33 | 9.65 | 1.00 |
| 161-180 | 9.43 | 1.00 | 8.89 | 1.20 | **14.15** | 1.00 |
| 180+ | **10.82** | 1.40 | 9.96 | **3.10** | 10.28 | **2.50** |

Three distinct chase modes emerge. Against small targets (≤160), they attack the powerplay at 11.50 SR and cruise through the middle overs. Against mid-range targets (161-180), they play the long game: a measured powerplay (9.43), steady accumulation, then explode at the death (14.15 SR). That death-overs acceleration is the signature of a side that trusts its finishers.

Against 180+, the approach breaks. Powerplay aggression rises (10.82 SR), but it comes at a cost: 1.4 PP wickets per match. The middle overs become a graveyard, averaging 3.1 wickets per chase. By the time the death overs arrive, too many top-order batters are back in the dugout to sustain the required rate.

**The Collapse Zone: Middle Overs Under Pressure**

| Phase | 3+ Wkt Collapses | Total Chase Innings | Collapse Rate | Lost After Collapse |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Powerplay | 3 | 18 | 16.7% | 2/3 (66.7%) |
| **Middle** | **8** | **18** | **44.4%** | **6/8 (75.0%)** |
| Death | 4 | 16 | 25.0% | 4/4 (100.0%) |

In 44.4% of all chase innings, RCB lose 3 or more wickets in the middle overs. That is not a statistical blip. When it happens, they lose 75% of the time. Death-overs collapses are terminal (0/4 wins). One encouraging sign from 2025: they survived a middle-overs collapse in the 227 chase (match vs DC) and still won by 6 wickets. Depth, perhaps, beginning to mature.

**Early Wickets: The 1-Wicket Sweet Spot**

| PP Wickets Lost | Chases | Wins | Win% |
|-----------------|--------|------|------|
| 0 | 6 | 4 | 66.7% |
| **1** | **5** | **5** | **100.0%** |
| 2 | 4 | 1 | 25.0% |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |

Losing exactly one wicket in the powerplay correlates with a 100% chase win rate (5/5). The counterintuitive zero-wicket record (66.7%) likely reflects cautious starts against tough targets. Once two or more wickets fall in the first six overs, the chase win rate collapses to 25-33%. The coaching staff should understand: the optimal chase profile is Salt or Kohli going hard, one falling to a good ball in the process, and the other carrying through with Patidar or V Iyer arriving at a comfortable situation.

**Who Scales and Who Doesn't**

| Batter | SR (≤160) | SR (161-180) | SR (180+) | Scales? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Virat Kohli | 136.6 | 146.5 | **162.9** | Yes, +26.3 across bands |
| Phil Salt | 190.0 | 189.1 | 184.0 | No, consistently elite regardless |
| Rajat Patidar | 120.8 | 145.0 | **169.4** | Yes, +48.6 across bands |

Kohli scales his strike rate precisely to the required rate: 136.6 against small targets, 162.9 when the chase demands it. At 37, the greatest chaser in IPL history still adjusts better than anyone else in this squad. Salt is the opposite: a flat 184-190 regardless of the target. He does not modulate. He attacks. The target is irrelevant. Patidar is the surprise: his SR jumps from 120.8 to 169.4 as targets increase, with sixes climbing from 1 per innings (≤160) to 1.8 per innings (180+). He is developing the range-hitting that RCB need from a number 3.

**2025 Chase Evolution**

The year-over-year trend tells a story of improvement:
- 2023: 2/5 (40.0%) chase wins
- 2024: 3/6 (50.0%)
- 2025: 6/7 (85.7%)

In 2025, every chase of 180 or below was won. The lone failure was a 231 target where RCB were bowled out for 189 (that death-overs collapse: 7 wickets in the final 5 overs at 4.55 SR). But they also chased down 227 against DC with 8 balls to spare, proving they *can* handle big targets when the top order fires together.

### What This Means for 2026

RCB should want to chase. The data is overwhelming: better batting SR (+12.0), better bowling economy when defending (-0.23), higher chase win rate (61.1% vs 53.8%), and individual player splits that uniformly favour chasing.

The tactical prescription is specific. If RCB restrict opponents to 180 or below, they should win. They are 8/8 in that scenario. The bowling unit's primary job is not to take 10 wickets; it is to ensure the target stays below 180. Everything about the squad composition, Bhuvneshwar and Hazlewood's powerplay stranglehold, Krunal's middle-overs control, the five all-rounders providing depth, supports a "restrict then chase" identity.

The vulnerability is equally specific. When opponents breach 200, RCB's middle order faces a structural problem: the pressure of a high required rate produces 3.1 wickets per chase in the middle overs, and death-overs collapses become terminal. The 2025 coaching staff addressed this partly through improved depth (Tim David, Jitesh Sharma), but the 200+ record (1/6) remains the statistical evidence that this squad has a ceiling when chasing.

If the coaching staff want one operational priority for 2026 chase preparation: train the middle order to survive the 8-15 over block when the required rate exceeds 10 per over. That is where chases die.

## Venue Analysis: M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru

The Chinnaswamy has a reputation as a batting paradise, the kind of ground where 180 feels par and bowlers take up meditation. The data since 2023 (19 matches) tells a slightly more interesting story.

**Chinnaswamy Phase Profile (Since 2023, aggregated across innings)**

| Phase | Run Rate | Boundary % | Dot Ball % | Wkts/Match |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 23.6% | 42.3% | 1.6 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 18.6% | 28.4% | 2.5 |
| Death | 11.25 | 24.7% | 28.7% | 2.4 |

**vs. League Averages (All Venues)**

| Phase | Chinnaswamy RR | League RR | Delta |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 9.26 | -0.17 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 8.76 | +0.53 |
| Death | 11.25 | 10.87 | +0.38 |

Here's the surprise: the Chinnaswamy actually plays *slower* than average in the powerplay. That batting paradise reputation? It's really a middle-and-death-overs paradise. The middle-overs run rate sits 0.53 above the league average, a meaningful deviation that explains why spin control is gold dust here. The death-overs run rate (11.25) is 0.38 above average, rewarding teams who can hit when it matters.

**How RCB's Strengths Fit the Venue:**
- The powerplay bowling (8.73 economy in 2025) should thrive on a ground where the powerplay is actually not as scary as everyone assumes
- Krunal Pandya's 7.45 middle-overs economy is 1.84 runs per over below the venue average in that phase. That's not a bowler; that's a force field
- Death batting (David, Jitesh, Kohli) is perfectly suited to the Chinnaswamy's elevated death-overs scoring
- The risk: if opponents target RCB's thin spin depth in the middle overs, the venue's elevated scoring rate will turn a problem into a crisis

**Since 2023: 25-19 (56.8% win rate)**

### All-Time IPL (2008-2025)

| Opponent | W-L | Win % | Since-2023 W-L | Trend |
|----------|-----|-------|----------------|-------|
| PBKS | 19-18 | 51.4% | 6-1 | From coin-flip rivalry to total domination |
| DC | 19-14 | 57.6% | 3-2 | Historically RCB's best matchup among current teams |
| RR | 17-16 | 51.5% | 4-2 | Pace-on-pace battles now tilt RCB's way |
| KKR | 15-20 | 42.9% | 1-4 | Bad and getting worse. Spin is the recurring villain |
| MI | 14-20 | 41.2% | 2-2 | Long-standing deficit. Recent parity counts as progress |
| CSK | 13-21 | 38.2% | 3-2 | RCB's worst all-time record. Recent competitiveness is entirely new |
| SRH | 11-14 | 44.0% | 2-2 | Below .500 historically but balanced now |
| LSG | 4-2 | 66.7% | 2-2 | Small sample. Early dominance has leveled off |
| GT | 3-3 | 50.0% | 2-2 | Not enough data to mean anything yet |

**All-Time: 132-138 (48.9% win rate)**

**What the Numbers Say:**

The CSK and MI problem is ancient history. RCB's 38.2% and 41.2% all-time records against CSK and MI are the franchise's historical bruises. But since 2023, both matchups sit at 50-60%. The bowling-first identity has leveled what used to be lopsided rivalries. Think of it like a team that finally learned to defend set pieces: the old weaknesses no longer apply.

The KKR problem is alive and well. 1-4 since 2023 against a team RCB were already 15-20 against all-time. KKR's dual-spin attack (Narine + Varun Chakravarthy) finds RCB's off-spin gap in the middle overs like water finds a crack. Until that deficiency is genuinely addressed, every potential KKR playoff matchup should come with a health warning.

PBKS went from rival to afterthought. A historically dead-even rivalry (19-18) has become 6-1 since 2023. RCB's bowling transformation has simply overwhelmed PBKS's approach. This is no longer a competitive fixture.

## Players to Watch

### Phil Salt: The Human Powerplay

177.5 career strike rate across 595 balls (HIGH sample). Salt is among the most destructive openers in the IPL, and yet he doesn't get the spotlight because he plays alongside the most famous cricketer on the planet. In 2026, his role is existential: RCB's team powerplay SR of 154.1 needs a jolt, and Salt is the only player in this squad who can single-handedly provide it. Against fast-medium bowling, he strikes at 179.7 across 207 balls (HIGH). Against left-arm orthodox, 180.4 across 56 balls (MEDIUM). His numbers against pace are almost unfair. The one flag: 123.6 SR against leg-spin across 55 balls (MEDIUM). Teams with a quality leggie have a genuine route to muzzle him.

### Rajat Patidar: The Weight of the Crown

Patidar's numbers tell two very different stories. Against leg-spin, he's devastating: 225.0 SR across 72 balls (MEDIUM), treating leggies like bowling machine fodder. Against fast bowling, more mortal: 129.1 SR across 110 balls (MEDIUM). He's never captained at this level before, and he's taking charge of a team riding momentum. His recent form is the elephant in the room: 120.8 SR in his last 10 innings, down 39.9 points from his 160.7 since-2023 SR. If Patidar rediscovers even his average form, RCB's middle order strengthens considerably. If the captaincy weighs on his blade, the number 4 slot becomes the soft underbelly.

### Bhuvneshwar Kumar: The Man Holding the Building Up

At 36, Bhuvneshwar has no business still being this good. His 8.26 powerplay economy across 99 overs (HIGH) and 47.5% dot ball percentage in the powerplay are numbers most bowlers ten years younger would trade a limb for. He is RCB's only bowler who can reliably open an innings with genuine swing. But his death bowling, 10.96 economy across 48 overs (MEDIUM), tells the other story. His 22.2% dot ball rate at the death is among the lowest for frontline seamers. If he breaks down, there is no like-for-like replacement in this squad. None. Zero. Bhuvneshwar's fitness is, quietly, the single most important variable in RCB's entire season. It's the cricketing equivalent of a building's foundation: nobody notices it until it cracks.

### Krunal Pandya: The Man Who Makes the Highlights Possible

Krunal doesn't do viral moments. What he does is win matches while nobody's watching. His 7.45 economy in the middle overs across 82 overs (MEDIUM) is elite by any standard, and his 30.3% dot ball rate in that phase creates the pressure that makes the death-overs fireworks possible. His 25 middle-overs wickets are the most for any RCB bowler in that phase. But here's the stat that tells you everything: 12.0% boundary rate in the middle overs, compared to the 17.6% league average. He concedes boundaries at roughly two-thirds the rate of the average bowler. He's the reason the bowling-first identity works, and he has no understudy in this squad.

---

## Players Who Need to Step Up

**1. Devdutt Padikkal: The Middle-Overs Missing Piece**

RCB's middle-overs batting (143.9 SR in 2025) is their weakest offensive phase, and Padikkal (2.00 Cr, retained) has the toolkit to fix it. He's a left-hander who can bat at 3 or 4, and his 186.9 SR against fast bowling (MEDIUM, 99 balls) shows real stroke-play ability. The problem: 131.6 career SR and a recent form SR of 151.5 (last 10) that still sits below most starters. His 108.8 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 34 balls) and 62.5 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 8 balls) are developmental red flags. But if Padikkal can sustain his upswing and push for the XI, he gives the middle order something it currently lacks: a left-handed option who can actually bat.

**2. Venkatesh Iyer: Converting KKR Pedigree to RCB Impact**

The 7.00 Cr marquee buy comes from a very different system. At KKR, Iyer batted in a lineup that played aggressive, spin-heavy cricket. At RCB, he walks into a bowling-first franchise that values the middle-overs grind. His all-T20 L10 form (136.8 SR across IPL and SMAT 2024/25) is a significant step below his IPL-specific L10 of 162.1 SR. The SMAT matches from December 2024 — where he managed 115.2 SR in one innings — drag the cross-format number down. His part-time seam bowling (7.53 economy in all-T20 L10, 5 wickets across 3 SMAT matches) could be valuable in a squad short on bowling variety. The question: can he bat at 3 in a system that asks him to both stabilize and accelerate? His innings-context split (+0.3 SR delta between setting and chasing) says he won't change based on situation — same batter, same approach. That's either reassuringly consistent or frustratingly one-dimensional. RCB need the former.

**3. Suyash Sharma: The Middle-Overs Anchor Expanding His Range**

Suyash (2.60 Cr, retained) has built a genuine middle-overs identity: 8.78 economy, 13 wickets in 78 overs (MEDIUM), bowling 264 of his 300 balls in overs 7-15. He's a pure middle-overs leg-spinner and a central pillar of the bowling-first identity. His best overs tell the story: over 7 at 5.83 economy, over 15 at 6.33 — bookending the spin phase with genuine control. The step-up isn't about bowling at the death (that may never be his role). It's about maintaining his 2025 standards under the weight of a title defence. At 26 IPL caps, he's experienced enough to be trusted but young enough that complacency is a risk. If he can replicate or improve his 2025 middle-overs numbers, RCB's spin control stays elite. His 3 powerplay wickets at 7.33 economy (LOW, 3 overs) hint at versatility if the coaching staff want to experiment.

**What the Cross-Format Picture Changes:**

The biggest revelation is **Phil Salt**. His IPL L10 of 180.2 SR was from April-June 2025 — seven months ago. His current form, all 10 recent T20 matches from ILT20 2025/26 (weight: 0.49), shows 128.1 SR. No weighting adjustment applies since all 10 matches are the same tournament. UAE conditions — flat tracks, shorter boundaries at Sharjah — are friendlier than IPL venues, making 128.1 look worse, not better. This is not rust. This is a genuine current-form dip.

**Jitesh Sharma** is the inverse story. His L10 spans IPL 2025 (6 matches, weight 0.87), SA tour of India (2 matches, weight 0.53), and India tour of Australia (2 matches, weight 0.58). The weighted SR (195.1) is slightly above raw (191.0) because the 6 IPL matches carry the highest weight and his IPL SR (176.6) is strong. The India tour of Australia weight (0.58) is the highest of any bilateral series — 93% of players in that series have IPL experience, making it the most IPL-transferable bilateral T20I data available.

**Tim David** at 167.7 weighted SR across BBL (4 matches, 0.53), ILT20 (3, 0.49), and India tour of Australia (3, 0.58) is almost identical to his raw (168.1). The Ind tour of Aus weight (0.58) gives his T20I matches slightly more pull than the franchise leagues, but the effect is marginal. He's performing across three continents — genuinely strong.

**Venkatesh Iyer** is the most data-limited case. His L10 is IPL 2025 (7 matches, April-May 2025) plus SMAT 2024/25 (3 matches, December 2024). The SMAT data is 14 months old — the oldest in any player's L10. His IPL-specific SR (162.1) is the primary signal; the SMAT matches, where he managed 115.2 SR in one innings and did not bat in another, add domestic noise from a different season. The "Stale domestic data" label reflects that the cross-format picture for domestic-only players inevitably includes dated information that may not reflect current form.

**Romario Shepherd** had the biggest correction from previous estimates. His entire L10 is ILT20 2025/26 (10 matches). At 147.8 SR, he's performing adequately for a No. 7/8 allrounder — most death-overs specialists in franchise cricket average 140-160 SR globally. His IPL L10 SR of 260.7 is from just 28 balls (73 runs across a handful of cameos) and should not be treated as a reliable baseline.

**Krunal Pandya** batted in only 4 of his last 10 matches (59 balls total) — below any meaningful analytical threshold. The 145.8 SR is dominated by one 73 off 46 (158.7 SR) against DC. His value to RCB is his bowling (7.17 economy, see below).

**Patidar** (120.8) and **Kohli** (144.5) have L10s that are entirely IPL — no weighting adjustment needed. The actual red flag remains Patidar: a -39.9 SR delta from his since-2023 average. For a new captain, that's an alarm bell.

| Suyash Sharma | 9.20 | 9.20 | 9.20 | 6 | IPL 2025 (10) | Steady |
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | 9.89 | 9.89 | 9.89 | 12 | IPL 2025 (10) | Concerning |
| Yash Dayal | 9.65 | 9.65 | 9.65 | 7 | IPL 2025 (10) | Economy pressure |

**Hazlewood is the standout.** His L10 is the most internationally diverse: 3 IPL matches (0.87 weight), 3 SA tour of Australia (0.50), 2 Australia tour of NZ (0.53), and 2 India tour of Australia (0.58). The weighted economy (8.37) is slightly above raw (8.20) because his IPL matches — where he went at 9.32 — carry the highest weight. Even so, 8.37 is excellent across four different series and conditions. He's arriving with 18 wickets in 10 matches. Krunal's 7.17 is entirely IPL (10 matches) and is the best bowling economy in the squad. Shepherd's ILT20 bowling economy (8.15) is significantly better than his IPL number (11.21) — cross-format data suggests more bowling competence than IPL figures imply.

### Bowlers (Individual Phase Economies, Since 2023)

| Player | Primary Phase | Econ (Primary) | Secondary Phase | Econ (Secondary) | Role |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | PP | 8.26 (99 ov, HIGH) | Death | 10.96 (48 ov, MEDIUM) | Primary new-ball |
| Josh Hazlewood | PP | 7.54 (28 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 10.65 (15 ov, LOW) | Primary new-ball |
| Krunal Pandya | Middle | 7.45 (82 ov, MEDIUM) | n/a | n/a | Primary middle-overs |
| Suyash Sharma | Middle | 8.78 (78 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 10.67 (12 ov, LOW) | Secondary middle-overs (leg-spin) |
| Yash Dayal | Overall | 9.85 (113 ov, HIGH) | PP / Death | 9.67 / 11.73 | Primary death (status uncertain) |

The individual phase numbers confirm the structural fault line: death bowling. Both Hazlewood (10.65) and Bhuvneshwar (10.96) become expensive at the death, and Yash Dayal's 11.73 death economy is the most concerning number in the entire bowling unit — made worse by the fact that nobody knows if he'll even be available.

> **Data Coverage Note:** All statistics are drawn from Cricsheet's ball-by-ball T20 archive (9,496 matches through January 31, 2026). Major tournaments covered: IPL (2008-2025), BBL (2011-2026), ILT20 (2023-2026), SMAT (2016-2024/25, partial for latest season), CPL, PSL, The Hundred, SA20, Super Smash, and bilateral T20I series (SA tour of India, India tour of Australia, SA tour of Australia, Aus tour of NZ — all confirmed present in database). SMAT 2025/26 data is not yet available from Cricsheet. Vijay Hazare Trophy (List A/50-over format) is not covered — T20-only database. Bilateral T20I series weights are computed per-series using the same 5-factor model as franchise leagues (PQI from IPL player overlap, competitiveness from match margins, recency, conditions similarity to India, sample confidence from match count).

## Momentum & Scoring Tendencies

The recent form tells you *what* each player is doing. This section tells you *how* they do it — the micro-patterns that reveal whether a player builds innings patiently or detonates from ball one.

### Dot Ball Discipline: Who Rotates, Who Stalls

| Player | PP Dot % | League PP Avg | Middle Dot % | League Mid Avg | Death Dot % | League Death Avg |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Virat Kohli | **33.5%** | 42.2% | **22.5%** | 29.3% | **21.1%** | 28.1% |
| Phil Salt | **37.8%** | 42.2% | **24.3%** | 29.3% | — | — |
| Rajat Patidar | 40.5% | 42.2% | 28.3% | 29.3% | 28.5% | 28.1% |
| Jitesh Sharma | **72.7%** | 42.2% | **35.1%** | 29.3% | 25.2% | 28.1% |
| Tim David | — | — | 33.0% | 29.3% | 28.7% | 28.1% |
| Krunal Pandya | 60.5% | 42.2% | 25.5% | 29.3% | 25.5% | 28.1% |

Kohli is the most efficient dot-ball avoider in the squad — 7-9% below league average across all three phases. He doesn't play dots. He rotates, nudges, works gaps. Salt mirrors this efficiency in the powerplay and middle overs. Together, they explain why RCB's team dot ball rate in the powerplay (37.8%) is 4.4% below the league average. The opening partnership doesn't just score quickly; it scores *constantly*.

Jitesh Sharma's 72.7% dot ball rate in the powerplay is a red flag — but context matters. He rarely bats in the powerplay (small sample). When he enters at the death (his designated phase), his 25.2% dot rate is *below* the league average. He's a death-overs weapon, not a top-order solution.

### Big Over Profiles: Detonators vs. Accumulators

| Player | 15+ Run Over Rate | Six-to-Four Ratio | Death Boundary % | Scoring Profile |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Romario Shepherd | 33.3% (small sample) | 1.10 | 47.7% | Pure detonator |
| Tim David | 8.3% | 1.02 | 24.8% | Power-first |
| Rajat Patidar | 5.4% | 1.02 | 20.3% | Six-heavy when set |
| Phil Salt | 7.6% | 0.46 | 31.6% | Boundary-heavy, prefers fours |
| Virat Kohli | 1.0% | 0.38 | 25.4% | Pure accumulator |

The six-to-four ratio is revealing. Shepherd (1.10) and David (1.02) hit more sixes than fours — they're genuine power hitters who clear the boundary more often than they pierce it. Patidar matches that ratio (1.02), suggesting his big-hitting is more evolved than his recent form SR might indicate. Salt, by contrast, is a boundary accumulator: 0.46 ratio means he hits roughly two fours for every six. Kohli at 0.38 is the purest rotator — his runs come from precision placement, not brute force.

### Team Momentum Patterns

RCB as a team generates 14.5% of overs at 15+ runs (vs 13.2% league average) — slightly more explosive. But the real insight is *when* these overs come.

**Over 14 is RCB's surge over:** 11.25 RPO (vs 8.93 league average, +2.32). This is where the acceleration kicks in, the transition from middle-overs control to death-overs assault. Over 10 also shows a +1.35 RPO surplus.

**Over 13 is a cold spot:** 7.67 RPO (vs 8.75 league, -1.08). A momentum trough right before the surge — suggesting RCB batters take a breath before the death-overs acceleration.

**Momentum sustainability:** After a big over (12+ runs), only 7.3% of RCB's next overs are dot-heavy (4+ dots), compared to 10.7% after a normal over. RCB sustains momentum after explosive overs better than the league average. Once they start hitting, they don't stop.

## Tactical Blueprint: How RCB Deploy Their Weapons

### Batting Order: Rigid at the Top, Situational in the Middle

| Batter | Avg Position | Most Common Spot | Avg Entry Over | Entry Under Pressure (2+ wkts in PP) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Phil Salt | 1.0 | #1 (100%) | 1.0 | Always opens |
| Virat Kohli | 1.3 | #1 (66%), #2 (30%) | 1.0 | Always opens |
| Rajat Patidar | 3.9 | #4 (74%) | 4.4 (stable) / 7.1 (pressure) | Drops to #4, enters later |
| Tim David | 6.7 | #7 (42%) | 14.9 | Always death, team ~141 at entry |
| Jitesh Sharma | 5.6 | #5-6 range | 11.9 | Flexible, overs 4-16 |
| Krunal Pandya | 7.0 | #7 (55%) | 12.0 | Team ~111 at entry |

The batting order tells a story of deliberate role clarity. Salt and Kohli always open — no exceptions across 44 innings. Patidar is locked at #4 in 74% of innings. The order barely changes between setting and chasing (Kohli: 1.38 setting vs 1.39 chasing). This is a team that trusts its structure and doesn't panic-promote.

**Patidar is the key flex player.** In stable starts (0-1 wickets in PP), he enters around over 4.4 at position ~3. Under pressure (2+ PP wickets), he drops to #4 and enters at over 7.1 — a stabilizer, not an accelerator. This is deliberate: Patidar absorbs pressure while the lower-order power hitters wait for their designated death-overs window.

**Tim David enters at over 14.9 on average** with the team score around 141. He's a pure death hitter — not a middle-order rescuer. His role is non-negotiable: bat 10-15 balls, hit at 184+ SR, and finish.

### Bowling Deployment: The 20-Over Template

**Phase allocation across 2023-2025:**

| Phase | Pace % | Spin % | Key Pattern |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Powerplay (1-6) | 77-96% | 4-21% | Near-total pace dominance; over 6 sees first spin creep in |
| Middle (7-15) | 25-59% | **41-73%** | Spin-first strategy: 60% spin across middle overs (~5.4 spin overs per match) |
| Death (16-20) | 60-90% | 10-40% | Return to pace, but spin isn't abandoned entirely |

**Middle-overs spin by season:** 2023: 72.9% spin → 2024: 42.2% → 2025: 66.2%. The 2024 dip (likely Maxwell's departure reducing spin options) was corrected in 2025 with Krunal and Suyash reclaiming the middle overs. The 2025 championship was built on this spin-control formula.

### Individual Bowling Maps

**Josh Hazlewood** is NOT a powerplay-only bowler. He bowled at the death in 67% of matches (10/15). Phase split: PP 51.9%, Middle 20.4%, Death 27.8%. His over 19 is devastating: 6.75 economy and 5 wickets in 24 balls — that's his yorker over, the one he saves for the kill shot. Teams who assume Hazlewood finishes after the powerplay are making a tactical error.

**Bhuvneshwar Kumar** is a PP specialist who also handles death: PP 186 balls (8.23 econ), Death 108 balls (11.11 econ). He almost never bowls in the middle overs (only 18 balls across 3 seasons). The coaching staff treats middle overs 7-15 as Krunal-Suyash territory, and Bhuvneshwar's overs are rationed across the bookends.

**Suyash Sharma** is a pure middle-overs asset: 264 of 300 balls (88%) bowled in overs 7-15. Only 36 death balls across three seasons. His best overs: over 7 at 5.83 economy, over 15 at 6.33 — bookending the spin phase. He is not a death bowler. He is not being developed as one. His role is to control the middle, and he does it well.

**Krunal Pandya** bowls 67.8% of his overs in the middle phase at 7.26 economy — best among all RCB bowlers. Only 7.4% of his overs come at the death. He is the midfield anchor: his job is to suffocate between overs 7-15 and hand the ball back to the pace bowlers with the opposition under pressure.

### The Bowling-First Template (What RCB Actually Do)

1. **Overs 1-3:** Hazlewood + Bhuvneshwar. Pure pace. 7.54 and 8.26 economy. Swing and seam.
2. **Overs 4-6:** Second spells of openers or Yash Dayal. Dot ball accumulation phase.
3. **Overs 7-10:** Krunal comes on. Suyash follows. Spin takes over. ~60% spin deliveries.
4. **Overs 11-15:** Krunal + Suyash continue. Occasional Hazlewood over if needed. The control phase.
5. **Overs 16-18:** Return to pace. Bhuvneshwar/Dayal. Economy rises.
6. **Overs 19-20:** Hazlewood's death overs (6.75 econ in over 19). The kill shot.

This template barely changes between bowling first and defending. Spin in the middle overs: 62% bowling first vs 59.8% defending. Pace at death: 76.1% vs 75.8%. The coaching staff runs the same playbook regardless of innings context. It's rigid, it's predictable, and it won the title.

## Interesting Data Insights

**1. Kohli's Death-Overs SR Is Real. But Read the Fine Print.**

Virat Kohli's 183.3 SR at the death across 114 balls (MEDIUM, 15 innings) ranks among the best in the squad. Sounds like a designated finisher, right? Not so fast. Kohli entered in the powerplay in all 44 of his innings since 2023. Every. Single. Time. He never walked in at the death as a pinch-hitter. His death-overs numbers come exclusively from batting through, meaning he only reaches overs 16-20 in 15 of 44 innings (34%). When he does bat at the death, he's already set, already in rhythm, already seeing it like a football. Compare that to Tim David, who enters specifically to hit from ball one with cold hands and fresh eyes. Both approaches are valuable. They are not the same skill, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest analysis.

**2. Patidar vs. Leg-Spin Is a Mismatch, and Not in the Bowler's Favor**

Rajat Patidar strikes at 225.0 against leg-spin across 72 balls (MEDIUM). That's the highest SR against any bowling type for any RCB batter with a meaningful sample. He's been dismissed just 3 times in those 72 balls, averaging 54.0. And here's the telling detail: his wrist-spin SR (smaller sample at 32 balls) drops to 112.5, suggesting he reads leg-spin *specifically* with unusual clarity, not wrist-spin in general. He's picking up the googly like he's got the answer sheet. Opposition captains: do not bowl your leggie to Patidar. You have been warned.

**3. Jitesh Sharma's Best Cricket Is Hiding Where It Matters Most**

Jitesh's recent form SR of 176.6 (last 10 innings) is 20.5 points above his since-2023 mark, but the real story lives in the phase breakdown. His 191.6 death SR across 178 balls (MEDIUM) is the highest among designated finishers in the RCB squad, above Tim David (184.6) and Kohli (183.3). At 11.00 Cr, Jitesh was an expensive retention that raised eyebrows. If his death-overs form continues, those eyebrows should be settling back down. A finisher who can also keep wicket is worth every rupee.

**4. Hazlewood's Dot Ball Rate Defies Logic**

Josh Hazlewood's 54.2% dot ball percentage in the powerplay (28 overs, MEDIUM) is borderline absurd. More than half of every delivery he bowls in the powerplay yields zero runs. For context, the team's overall powerplay dot ball rate is around 40-43%. Hazlewood isn't just economical; he's methodical, building dot-ball sequences that force batters into errors they wouldn't normally make. His 12 powerplay wickets in just 15 matches since 2023 are the direct consequence. Dot balls create pressure. Pressure creates wickets. Hazlewood creates dot balls. It's beautifully simple.

**5. The Left-Arm Pace Blind Spot Nobody's Talking About**

Yash Dayal is the only left-arm pacer in the predicted XII, and his availability is a question mark. Mangesh Yadav (left-arm fast, 6 matches) is the only backup, but his 12.33 powerplay economy (LOW, 6 overs) says he's not ready for that responsibility yet. If Dayal is unavailable, RCB loses all left-arm pace variation. That means opponents can stack right-handed batters without worrying about angle changes. It's like a football team losing its only left-footed defender: suddenly, everyone knows which way you're going.

---

## The Bold Take

**Virat Kohli is no longer RCB's most important player. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is.**

This will upset people. Good. The data is unambiguous. Kohli's 2,037 runs at 146.6 SR are extraordinary, but his powerplay SR (151.9) and middle-overs SR (134.2) are not pace-setting numbers. His elite contribution comes at the death (183.3 SR), but as we've established, that's a consequence of batting through, not a designated role. More importantly: take Kohli out of this team, and RCB's batting still has options (Salt, Patidar, Venkatesh Iyer, David, Padikkal). Take Bhuvneshwar out, and the bowling-first identity, the very thing that underpinned the 73.3% win rate in 2025, collapses like a house of cards. There is no backup swing bowler. There is no second powerplay specialist who can match his 8.26 economy. At 36, Bhuvneshwar Kumar isn't RCB's sentimental veteran. He is the foundation. His 47.5% powerplay dot ball rate is not replaceable by anyone in this squad. Full stop.

## By the Numbers

| Stat | Value | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| **8.73** | RCB's 2025 powerplay bowling economy | Down from 9.77 in 2024. A run-per-over improvement that rewired the entire franchise |
| **183.3** | Kohli's death SR (114 balls, MEDIUM) | Comes from batting through in 15/44 innings, not as a designated finisher |
| **-39.9** | Patidar's SR delta (last 10 vs since-2023) | The new captain's batting form is the squad's biggest concern |
| **7.45** | Krunal's middle-overs economy (82 overs, MEDIUM) | 1.44 runs per over below the league average. The invisible engine |
| **1.4 / 10** | Off-spin depth chart rating | No frontline off-spinner in the squad. Leg-spin covered (Suyash), but off-spin remains the genuine gap |

---

## Keys to Victory

**1. Bhuvneshwar Must Stay Fit for 14+ Matches**

RCB's bowling identity lives and dies with the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar powerplay partnership. Hazlewood, as an overseas player, may have availability windows. Bhuvneshwar, at 36, has managed workload concerns for years. If he misses more than 3-4 games, RCB's powerplay bowling economy could slide back toward the 9.77 wasteland of 2024. The franchise has no like-for-like replacement: Mangesh Yadav and Yash Dayal are not swing bowlers. This is the single biggest structural risk in the squad, and there's no auction buy that can fix it mid-season.

**2. The Middle Order Must Carry More Than 42-43% of Runs**

In 2025, RCB's top 3 (Kohli, Salt, and the third batter) scored the lion's share. With Venkatesh Iyer slotting in at 3, the middle order (Patidar at 4, David at 5, Jitesh at 6) needs to pick up more of the tab. Specifically, Patidar's -39.9 SR delta has to reverse. If the middle order can push toward 50-55% of the run contribution, it reduces the collapse risk that has haunted RCB since approximately forever.

**3. The Off-Spin Gap Cannot Be Wished Away**

The 1.4/10 off-spin depth rating isn't a quirk. It's a structural vulnerability that competent opposition coaches will identify within minutes of reviewing the squad list. Without a frontline off-spinner, RCB cannot create matchup advantages against left-handed batters in the middle overs. Suyash Sharma's leg-spin and Krunal's left-arm orthodox give RCB two spin axes, but neither turns the ball into a left-hander the way an off-spinner does. Opponents with left-hand-heavy middle orders (KKR, SRH) will exploit this gap. Krunal's left-arm orthodox is not a substitute for genuine off-spin. Different angle, different purpose.

**4. Overseas Slot Management Must Be Ruthless**

RCB has 7 overseas players: Salt, Hazlewood, David, Shepherd, Bethell, Duffy, and Cox. Only 4 can play. Salt (keeper-opener) and Hazlewood (lead seamer) are locked in. David (death finisher) is near-certain. The fourth slot is a genuine puzzle: Shepherd (pace AR), Bethell (batting AR with left-arm spin), or Duffy (pace depth). Getting this right, and being willing to rotate based on opposition rather than sentimentality, is what separates a good squad from a championship defence. The risk: falling in love with a combination and refusing to adapt.

---

## Andy Flower's Scouting Report

**Tactical Identity:** Bowling-first, death-finishing. RCB's game plan is to strangle opponents through overs 1-15 via the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar-Krunal axis, then unleash batting firepower in overs 16-20. It's the cricketing equivalent of rope-a-dope: absorb, control, then strike.

**Structural Strengths:**
- Powerplay bowling (Hazlewood at 7.54 PP economy + Bhuvneshwar at 8.26) is among the best two-bowler pairings in IPL
- Middle-overs spin control (Krunal at 7.45 economy across 82 overs) is elite
- Death-overs batting depth (David 184.6 SR / 286 balls, Jitesh 191.6 SR / 178 balls, Kohli 183.3 SR / 114 balls) gives three separate threats
- Chinnaswamy's slightly below-average powerplay scoring rate suits the bowling attack

**Structural Vulnerabilities:**
- Off-spin is effectively absent (1.4/10 depth rating) — the only genuine spin gap
- Powerplay batting relies almost entirely on Salt
- Top 3 dependency (57.7% of runs in 2025) creates knockout-stage collapse risk
- Yash Dayal's off-field status creates left-arm pace depth uncertainty
- Bhuvneshwar's workload management at 36 is a season-long tightrope walk
- Death bowling economy (10.75 in 2025) remains the weakest bowling phase

**Opposition Blueprint:** Bowl off-spin in the middle overs — that's the genuine gap RCB cannot counter (130.8 SR, -1.5 vs league). Force Kohli into the middle overs where he strikes at 134.2 SR, materially below his powerplay (151.9) and death (183.3) rates. Avoid the powerplay bowling duel with Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar at all costs. If chasing, do not let the game reach overs 16-20 with RCB needing less than 50. Their death batting is too deep to defend against.

**Matchup Targets:** Kohli's weakest bowling type matchup is right-arm off-spin at 101.9 SR (53 balls, MEDIUM). That's exploitable with a quality off-spinner. Tim David's wrist-spin vulnerability (33.3 SR, 9 balls) is a small sample but worth probing. Patidar's form slump (-39.9 SR delta) suggests he may be susceptible to early pressure if the new-ball bowlers can create doubt before he settles.

---

## Verdict

RCB in 2026 is a team that finally knows what it is. And in the IPL, self-knowledge is worth more than any auction paddle.

The bowling-first identity that delivered a maiden title in 2025 returns with its championship core intact, bolstered by Venkatesh Iyer's batting depth and Shepherd's death-overs chaos. If Bhuvneshwar stays fit, Patidar's form recovers, and the off-spin gap doesn't prove fatal, this is a top-4 squad with a genuine shot at back-to-back titles. If any of those three pillars wobble, the defending champions will learn what every champion eventually learns: winning it was the fun part. Keeping it is the real test.

**Projected Finish: 3rd-4th** | **Ceiling: Champions** | **Floor: 6th**
