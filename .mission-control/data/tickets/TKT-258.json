Read CSK stat pack (848 lines), depth chart JSON, predicted XII JSON. Cross-referenced league averages for all phase data."

      "detail": "Wrote full 21-section CSK season preview (~5,200 words). Narrative hook: Dhoni's final chapter and the post-dynasty transition. Key editorial angles: (1) CSK's 28.6% win rate in 2025 was worst in franchise history, (2) Samson trade as the transformational move, (3) Noor Ahmad as the bowling anchor at 20 years old, (4) 28.40 Cr gamble on uncapped talent (Prashant Veer + Kartik Sharma), (5) Dhoni's pace-vs-spin split as the ageing narrative. Bold take: Noor Ahmad, not Gaikwad, is the most important player -- backed by replacement analysis. Verdict: 5th-7th projected, ceiling 4th (playoffs), floor 9th. All 21 sections follow approved RCB template structure exactly. Every stat includes sample size and confidence label. SR used for per-100-balls, RPO used for per-over metrics. No fabricated numbers."
