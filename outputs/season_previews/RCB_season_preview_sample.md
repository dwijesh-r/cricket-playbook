## The Headline

**The Bowling-First Revolution Is Real. Now Comes the Hard Part.**

For a decade, watching RCB bowl was like watching someone parallel park a bus. Entertaining, occasionally heroic, but mostly just painful. That changed in 2025. The franchise that once treated bowling as something that happened between batting collapses posted a 73.3% win rate, won their maiden IPL title, and did it with a powerplay bowling attack that conceded over a run per over fewer than the league average. The question for 2026 isn't whether RCB can bat. It's whether a franchise built on vibes and Kohli can defend a title built on discipline.

---

## The Story

The 2025 season wasn't just the most significant in RCB's 18-year history because of the trophy. It was significant because of *how* that trophy was won. After the mega auction stripped the squad to its studs (only Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal survived from 2024), RCB did something nobody expected: they became boring. Gloriously, effectively, championship-winningly boring.

Josh Hazlewood (12.50 Cr, retained) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (10.75 Cr, retained) turned the powerplay into a graveyard for opening batters. Hazlewood at 7.54 economy, Bhuvneshwar at 8.26 across their IPL careers since 2023. The team's powerplay bowling economy dropped from 9.77 in 2024 to 8.73 in 2025, a transformation of over a run per over. For the first time in franchise history, the opening pair with the ball was doing what the opening pair with the bat had always done: setting the terms of engagement.

The middle overs belonged to Krunal Pandya (5.75 Cr, retained). Think of him as the midfield anchor in a football team, the guy who never makes the highlight reel but whose absence turns the whole system into chaos. His 7.45 middle-overs economy across 82 overs gave RCB something they'd never had before: a phase of controlled, suffocating pressure. Opponents couldn't recover from Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar starts because Krunal refused to let them breathe.

The death overs revealed a different animal entirely: Tim David (3.00 Cr, retained) at 184.6 SR across 286 balls at the death, with Jitesh Sharma (11.00 Cr, retained) at 191.6 SR across 178 balls alongside him. The team that once needed Kohli to anchor every chase now has designated finishers who can close out an innings without needing an anchor at all. The result: RCB beat Punjab Kings by 6 runs in the Final to claim their maiden IPL crown.

For 2026, the title-winning core returns largely intact, with 15 players retained. Six auction purchases, headlined by Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr), shore up the batting depth. The question marks are specific and unavoidable. Can Yash Dayal's off-field situation be resolved? Can the spin depth survive if opponents target the off-spin and wrist-spin gaps? And can the middle order shoulder more of the load now that the defending champions have a target painted on their backs?

## Off-Season Changes

**Captaincy:** Rajat Patidar stays on as captain after leading RCB to the promised land in 2025. His batting position at number 4 gives him a tactical vantage point, and winning a title tends to silence any dressing-room debate about authority. The continuity matters here: no leadership disruption heading into a title defence.

**Key Departures (from 2025 squad):** Liam Livingstone (to SRH), Lungi Ngidi (to DC), MA Agarwal, and MS Bhandage. Livingstone's departure removes a power-hitting overseas swiss army knife who could bat anywhere from 3 to 6. But Ngidi's exit stings more. He was Hazlewood's partner in crime, the second overseas seamer who brought genuine pace and bounce. Losing him is like a restaurant losing its sous chef: the head chef is still there, but the kitchen runs thinner.

**Key Retentions:** RCB kept 15 players from the championship squad, anchored by Kohli (21.00 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), Salt (11.50 Cr), Patidar (11.00 Cr), and Jitesh Sharma (11.00 Cr). Kanishk Chouhan (0.30 Cr), a 19-year-old uncapped off-spin all-rounder, is a low-cost retention that tells you RCB see potential worth developing, even if the current spin depth doesn't reflect it yet.

**Auction Strategy:** Six purchases totaling 10.65 Cr, with Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr) as the marquee buy. Romario Shepherd (2.00 Cr) was re-acquired at auction after playing for RCB in 2025 but not being retained. The remaining buys (Duffy, Deswal, Mangesh Yadav, Jordan Cox) were all below 1 Cr, focused on pace depth and backup options. The message was clear: keep the band together, fill the gaps cheap, and trust the system.

**What's Structurally Different from 2025:** The overseas pace equation has shifted. RCB went from two premium overseas quicks (Hazlewood + Ngidi) to one, and swapped Livingstone's batting utility for Venkatesh Iyer's Indian all-rounder profile. This frees overseas slot flexibility (David, Bethell, Shepherd, or Duffy can rotate as the fourth overseas player) but makes the bowling attack more reliant on Indian seamers (Bhuvneshwar, Yash Dayal, Mangesh Yadav) to complement Hazlewood. It's a calculated bet: more batting options, less bowling insurance.

---

## New Additions

**Venkatesh Iyer (7.00 Cr, All-rounder, IND):** The headline act. Iyer's 149.9 SR and 31.6 average across 34 innings since 2023 (HIGH sample) bring genuine middle-order substance. A left-hander who can bat at 3 or 4 and chip in with part-time seam, he fills the Maxwell-shaped hole that's been in this squad. His 162.9 SR against fast bowling (MEDIUM, 151 balls) suggests he doesn't flinch against pace. The concern: 96.9 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 32 balls) and 75.0 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 16 balls). Limited data, but flags worth keeping on the radar.

**Romario Shepherd (2.00 Cr, All-rounder, WI):** Pure impact. 282.2 SR across 45 balls in IPL (LOW sample), including 127 runs at 288.6 SR at the death (LOW, 44 balls). His bowling economy of 12.23 across 26 overs isn't winning any awards, but his role is clear: come in at 7 or 8, hit with intent from ball one, and bowl a few overs of useful pace. He's a designated chaos agent, the sort of player whose value doesn't show up in career averages but shows up in win probability swings.

**Jacob Duffy (0.75 Cr, Bowler, NZ):** Uncapped in IPL. A right-arm fast-medium option providing pace depth behind Hazlewood. Break-glass-in-case-of-emergency insurance for the overseas seamer slot.

**Satvik Deswal (0.30 Cr, Bowler, IND):** An 18-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner addressing the most glaring gap on the depth chart. Uncapped in IPL. Deswal is a development pick, but the fact that RCB went looking for a left-arm wrist-spinner at all tells you how seriously they take their 1.3/10 depth chart rating in that department.

**Mangesh Yadav (0.30 Cr, Bowler, IND):** Left-arm fast bowler who has quietly impressed in 6 IPL matches: 9 wickets at 9.32 economy. His 48.5% dot ball percentage in the middle overs (LOW, 11 overs) is the kind of number that makes coaches lean forward. With Yash Dayal's status up in the air, Mangesh might be bowling with the new ball sooner than anyone planned.

**Jordan Cox (0.30 Cr, Wicketkeeper, ENG):** Backup keeper behind Salt and Jitesh. Uncapped in IPL. One of those picks you hope you never need to use.

## Team Style Analysis

If you showed someone RCB's 2024 numbers next to their 2025 numbers without telling them which team it was, they'd assume these were two completely different franchises. And they'd basically be right.

**2024: Still Living in the Past**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 156.9 | 9.77 |
| Middle | 146.9 | 9.53 |
| Death | 195.9 | 10.90 |

In 2024, RCB played like a team trying to outscore a house fire. A 195.9 death SR was eye-popping, but the bowling was forgettable: 9.77 in the powerplay, 10.90 at the death. The squad was built around batting firepower (Kohli, du Plessis, Maxwell, Patidar) with bowling essentially playing the role of "please don't lose it too badly."

**2025: Somebody Read the Memo**

| Phase | Batting SR | Bowling Economy | Delta from 2024 |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Powerplay | 154.1 | 8.73 | Bat: -2.8 / Bowl: -1.04 |
| Middle | 143.9 | 8.89 | Bat: -3.0 / Bowl: -0.64 |
| Death | 180.8 | 10.75 | Bat: -15.1 / Bowl: -0.15 |

Look at those bowling numbers. Powerplay economy improved by a full run per over. Middle-overs economy dropped from 9.53 to 8.89. Yes, batting strike rates came down across every phase (especially at the death, from 195.9 to 180.8), but that's the point. RCB stopped trying to win shootouts and started winning chess matches.

**Squad-Building Philosophy:** RCB has gone from stacking batting talent like it's going out of fashion to investing in bowling infrastructure. The retention of Bhuvneshwar (10.75 Cr), Hazlewood (12.50 Cr), and Krunal (5.75 Cr), three of the four priciest bowler retentions, tells you everything. They're top-heavy with the bat (Kohli + Salt own the powerplay; David + Jitesh own the death), lean in the middle order, and deep with bowling options. Five all-rounders (Venkatesh Iyer, Krunal, Shepherd, Bethell, Swapnil Singh) suggest a belief in flexibility over specialization. This is a franchise that has finally learned what every successful team already knows: you can't buy a title with batters alone. Someone has to actually get the other lot out.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Key Metric (2025) | Context |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Batting, Powerplay** | 6.5/10 | 154.1 SR | Above average, but it's basically a Salt solo show |
| **Batting, Middle** | 6.0/10 | 143.9 SR | League-average. This is where the engine sputters |
| **Batting, Death** | 8.0/10 | 180.8 SR | Elite trio of David (184.6), Jitesh (191.6), Kohli (183.3) |
| **Bowling, Powerplay** | 8.5/10 | 8.73 econ | Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar is a cheat code |
| **Bowling, Middle** | 7.5/10 | 8.89 econ | Krunal's 7.45 econ is the secret ingredient |
| **Bowling, Death** | 5.5/10 | 10.75 econ | Yash Dayal's status makes this worse; Bhuvneshwar at 10.96 is not death bowling |
| **Overall** | **7.0/10** | | Bowling core + death batting offset middle-overs batting and death bowling gaps |

The profile is clear: RCB are a team with sharp peaks and uncomfortable valleys. Powerplay bowling and death batting are elite. Middle-overs batting and death bowling are structural soft spots. The 7.0 reflects a squad that's excellent at what it does well, but doesn't have much room to improvise when Plan A gets shut down.

## Team Batting Profile: How RCB Handle Different Bowling

The squad-building section told you *what* RCB are. This section tells you where they score freely and where they get stuck.

### vs. Bowling Types (Since 2023)

| Bowling Type | RCB SR | League Avg SR | Diff | Verdict |
|-------------|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| Right-arm pace | 153.6 | 144.9 | +8.7 | Dominant. This is where the lineup does its best work |
| Left-arm pace | 156.4 | 146.8 | +9.6 | Even better. Angle variation makes no difference |
| Leg-spin | 144.5 | 141.1 | +3.4 | Comfortable. Patidar's 225.0 SR vs leggies does heavy lifting |
| Left-arm wrist-spin | 131.1 | 124.7 | +6.4 | Above average, but the small sample deserves caution |
| Left-arm orthodox | 138.7 | 138.3 | +0.4 | Dead average. Nothing notable |
| Off-spin | 130.8 | 132.3 | -1.5 | Below average. The only bowling type where RCB underperform |

The story is straightforward. RCB dominate pace bowling. Right-arm, left-arm, the result is the same. The squad is built around players who score quickly against seam, and the numbers confirm it: +8.7 SR against right-arm pace and +9.6 against left-arm pace versus the league. Salt, Kohli, Patidar, and David are all natural pace-hitters, and the combined effect is a lineup that consistently accelerates against anything over 130 kph.

The vulnerability is off-spin. RCB are 1.5 SR points *below* the league average against off-spinners, the only bowling type where they underperform. It's a small deficit, but it rhymes perfectly with the 1.4/10 off-spin depth chart rating on the bowling side. This is a squad that neither bowls off-spin effectively nor bats against it particularly well. It's like a football club with no left foot: you can work around it, but smart opponents will make you pay.

### Phase-Wise Batting (Since 2023)

| Phase | RCB SR | League SR | Diff | Boundary % (RCB / League) | Dot % (RCB / League) |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Powerplay | 150.2 | 140.6 | +9.6 | 24.6% / 23.3% | 36.9% / 40.5% |
| Middle | 138.8 | 135.4 | +3.4 | 16.1% / 16.2% | 26.0% / 28.3% |
| Death | 162.8 | 158.8 | +4.0 | 23.4% / 21.8% | 26.4% / 26.2% |

The powerplay is where RCB separate themselves. A +9.6 SR differential over the league, plus a dot ball rate 3.6 percentage points below average (36.9% vs 40.5%). Translation: RCB batters find gaps more often than any other team in the first six overs. Salt's 177.5 SR is the obvious engine, but Kohli's ability to rotate strike and let Salt take the risks makes this a two-man partnership that's greater than the sum of its parts.

Middle overs are adequate but not elite. The +3.4 SR gap narrows considerably here, and the boundary rate (16.1%) is almost identical to the league (16.2%). This is where Krunal's batting contribution (124.4 SR) and Patidar's form slump create a drag. The saving grace: a dot ball rate of 26.0% (vs 28.3% league), meaning they rotate well even when boundaries dry up. Busy, not brutal.

Death overs are strong (+4.0 SR) with a notably higher boundary rate (23.4% vs 21.8%). David, Jitesh, and late-innings Kohli combine to produce a three-pronged death assault that most teams simply can't match for depth.

### Where the Two Stories Collide: Phase x Bowling Type

| Scenario | RCB SR | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Powerplay vs. RA pace | 160.0 | Salt and Kohli destroying the most common new-ball attack |
| Death vs. LA pace | 181.5 | David and Jitesh dismantling left-arm death bowling at will |
| Middle vs. off-spin | 128.3 | 18 wickets lost. This is where campaigns get derailed |
| Middle vs. LA wrist-spin | 123.8 | 11 wickets lost. The slower it gets, the less comfortable they look |

This cross-reference is where the scouting report gets really interesting. RCB's powerplay batting against right-arm pace (160.0 SR) is frankly ridiculous. It's the single most dominant batting scenario for this squad, and it explains why teams that open with pace at the Chinnaswamy often find themselves staring at 55-60 after six overs.

But flip to the middle overs against off-spin: 128.3 SR and 18 wickets. That's not a soft spot; that's a trapdoor. Teams like KKR (Narine + Varun) and CSK (who always seem to have an off-spinner up their sleeve) have the toolkit to exploit this phase specifically. Add middle-overs wrist-spin (123.8 SR, 11 wickets) and you see the pattern: if you can slow RCB down between overs 7-15 with spin, their batting advantage evaporates.

The tactical implication is clear. Opposition captains should bowl pace in the powerplay (and accept the damage), then stack spin between overs 7-15. That's the window where RCB look mortal. If they survive the middle-overs spin squeeze, their death batting takes over and the game is usually done. The battle for the IPL against RCB in 2026 will be won or lost in overs 7-15.

---

## Innings Context: Setting vs Chasing

This might be the most important section in the entire preview, because it reveals something the phase-by-phase numbers don't: RCB are two entirely different teams depending on whether they bat first or second.

### The Big Picture (Since 2023)

| Scenario | Matches | Wins | Win % |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| Batting first (setting) | 26 | 14 | 53.8% |
| Batting second (chasing) | 18 | 11 | 61.1% |

That 7.3 percentage point gap is meaningful on its own. But the 2025 season makes it dramatic: RCB won 85.7% of their chases (6/7). Five of those were won with overs to spare.

### Team Batting: Two Different Gears

| Phase | Setting SR | Chasing SR | Delta | League Chase SR | RCB vs League |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Powerplay | 139.7 | 165.2 | +25.5 | 141.7 | **+23.5** |
| Middle | 134.5 | 145.4 | +10.9 | 137.2 | +8.2 |
| Death | 162.8 | 162.8 | 0.0 | 151.3 | +11.5 |
| **Overall** | **143.2** | **155.2** | **+12.0** | **141.5** | **+13.7** |

When setting a total, RCB bat at 143.2 SR. That's dead-on the league average of 143.1. Unremarkable. But when chasing, they jump to 155.2 SR, a full 13.7 points above the league average of 141.5. That's not a modest preference. That's a structural advantage.

The powerplay is where the transformation is most extreme. Setting: 139.7 SR, actually below league average. Chasing: 165.2 SR, some 23.5 points above the league. The explanation is straightforward: Salt and Kohli know the target. Salt, in particular, shifts from aggressive-but-calculated to outright assault mode when a scoreboard pressure exists to chase. His 174.5 chase SR (vs 162.2 setting) confirms this isn't team-level noise; it's Salt being given license to attack.

The death overs are identical (162.8 in both innings), which tells you David and Jitesh hit the same way regardless of context. That's a sign of genuine finishers, players whose approach doesn't change based on whether they're building or chasing. The difference is that in chases, RCB tend to arrive at the death in better positions because of the powerplay acceleration.

### Team Bowling: Better With Something to Defend

| Phase | Bowl First Econ | Defend Econ | Delta | Defend Dot% | Defend Wkt Rate |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Powerplay | 8.49 | 8.53 | +0.04 | 43.8% | 5.8% |
| Middle | 8.91 | 9.13 | +0.22 | 27.9% | 4.5% |
| Death | 10.71 | 9.44 | **-1.27** | 29.5% | 8.4% |
| **Overall** | **9.23** | **9.00** | **-0.23** | **33.4%** | **5.7%** |

The powerplay and middle-overs bowling is roughly similar regardless of innings. But look at the death overs: 9.44 economy defending vs 10.71 bowling first. That's a 1.27-run improvement. When RCB have a total on the board, their death bowlers concede fewer boundaries (20.0% vs 24.2%) and generate significantly more dot balls (29.5% vs 23.3%). They also take 50 wickets in 99 overs defending at death, compared to 36 in 92 overs bowling first. The pressure of a scoreboard target makes their death bowling visibly more effective.

### Individual Player Splits

**Batters:**

| Player | Setting SR | Chasing SR | Delta | Sample (Balls) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Virat Kohli | 137.6 | 147.8 | +10.2 | 835 / 601 (HIGH) |
| Phil Salt | 162.2 | 174.5 | +12.3 | 251 / 372 (MEDIUM) |
| Rajat Patidar | 154.7 | 149.3 | -5.4 | 322 / 140 (MEDIUM / LOW) |
| Tim David (career) | 143.1 | 166.8 | +23.7 | 246 / 184 (MEDIUM) |
| Jitesh Sharma (career) | 145.6 | 155.6 | +10.0 | 318 / 189 (MEDIUM) |
| Venkatesh Iyer | 144.6 | 144.9 | +0.3 | 332 / 301 (HIGH) |

Kohli is 10.2 SR points better chasing. The man who's spent two decades being described as the greatest chaser in cricket history still, at 37, demonstrably bats better with a target in front of him. Old habits, apparently.

Salt's +12.3 chase uplift makes the Kohli-Salt opening partnership particularly dangerous in the second innings. Both batters elevate their games when the equation is clear.

Tim David's career split is the standout: 166.8 chasing vs 143.1 setting, a 23.7-point gap. That's a player whose entire value proposition shifts depending on when he walks in. In a chase at the death, he's elite. Setting a total in the middle overs, he's ordinary.

Venkatesh Iyer is the exception: virtually no split difference (+0.3). He's the same batter regardless of context, which is actually useful for a number 3 who needs to be reliable in both scenarios.

Patidar bats marginally better when setting, but the chasing sample (140 balls) is too small to draw conclusions.

**Bowlers:**

| Bowler | Bowl First Econ | Defend Econ | Delta | Sample (Overs) |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Josh Hazlewood | 7.91 | 8.85 | +0.94 | 18 / 36 (LOW / MEDIUM) |
| Krunal Pandya | 7.36 | 8.75 | +1.39 | 24 / 24 (MEDIUM) |
| Suyash Sharma | 9.11 | 8.52 | -0.59 | 46 / 49 (MEDIUM) |
| Yash Dayal | 9.17 | 9.54 | +0.37 | 56 / 63 (MEDIUM) |
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | 8.98 | 9.44 | +0.46 | 23 / 31 (MEDIUM) |

Krunal's split is the most striking: 7.36 economy bowling first vs 8.75 defending, a 1.39-run gap. When RCB bowl first, Krunal is nearly untouchable in the middle overs. When defending, opponents bat more freely against him, likely because the scoreboard pressure is reversed. This is a significant tactical consideration for toss decisions.

Hazlewood shows a similar pattern (7.91 vs 8.85), though his bowling-first sample is small (18 overs). Suyash Sharma is the only bowler who's *better* defending (8.52 vs 9.11), possibly because his leg-spin creates more pressure when opponents are chasing.

### The Chase Approach: Anatomy of a Run Down

RCB have chased 18 times since 2023. Their overall record (11/18, 61.1%) flatters them slightly, because it hides a dramatic cliff at the 180-run mark.

**Chase Results by Target Band (Since 2023)**

| Target Band | Chases | Wins | Win% | League Win% | RCB vs League |
|-------------|--------|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| ≤140 | 1 | 1 | 100.0% | 75.0% | +25.0 |
| 141-160 | 2 | 2 | 100.0% | 87.0% | +13.0 |
| 161-180 | 5 | 5 | 100.0% | 61.4% | **+38.6** |
| 181-200 | 4 | 2 | 50.0% | 44.2% | +5.8 |
| 200+ | 6 | 1 | 16.7% | 23.6% | -6.9 |

Eight chases of 180 or below. Eight wins. Zero failures. The 161-180 band is where the differential is sharpest: RCB win 100% where the league average is 61.4%, a 38.6 percentage-point gap. Above 180, the picture inverts. The 200+ record (1/6, 16.7%) is below league average.

The conclusion is unavoidable: RCB are elite at chasing achievable targets but crumble when asked to go beyond their natural run rate. The bowling needs to keep targets below 180 for the batting to function at full capacity.

**How the Approach Changes by Target Size**

| Target Band | PP SR | PP Wkts/Match | Mid SR | Mid Wkts/Match | Death SR | Death Wkts/Match |
|-------------|-------|---------------|--------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| ≤160 | 11.50 | 1.00 | 8.37 | 2.33 | 9.65 | 1.00 |
| 161-180 | 9.43 | 1.00 | 8.89 | 1.20 | **14.15** | 1.00 |
| 180+ | **10.82** | 1.40 | 9.96 | **3.10** | 10.28 | **2.50** |

Three distinct chase modes emerge. Against small targets (≤160), they attack the powerplay at 11.50 SR and cruise through the middle overs. Against mid-range targets (161-180), they play the long game: a measured powerplay (9.43), steady accumulation, then explode at the death (14.15 SR). That death-overs acceleration is the signature of a side that trusts its finishers.

Against 180+, the approach breaks. Powerplay aggression rises (10.82 SR), but it comes at a cost: 1.4 PP wickets per match. The middle overs become a graveyard, averaging 3.1 wickets per chase. By the time the death overs arrive, too many top-order batters are back in the dugout to sustain the required rate.

**The Collapse Zone: Middle Overs Under Pressure**

| Phase | 3+ Wkt Collapses | Total Chase Innings | Collapse Rate | Lost After Collapse |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Powerplay | 3 | 18 | 16.7% | 2/3 (66.7%) |
| **Middle** | **8** | **18** | **44.4%** | **6/8 (75.0%)** |
| Death | 4 | 16 | 25.0% | 4/4 (100.0%) |

In 44.4% of all chase innings, RCB lose 3 or more wickets in the middle overs. That is not a statistical blip. When it happens, they lose 75% of the time. Death-overs collapses are terminal (0/4 wins). One encouraging sign from 2025: they survived a middle-overs collapse in the 227 chase (match vs DC) and still won by 6 wickets. Depth, perhaps, beginning to mature.

**Early Wickets: The 1-Wicket Sweet Spot**

| PP Wickets Lost | Chases | Wins | Win% |
|-----------------|--------|------|------|
| 0 | 6 | 4 | 66.7% |
| **1** | **5** | **5** | **100.0%** |
| 2 | 4 | 1 | 25.0% |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |

Losing exactly one wicket in the powerplay correlates with a 100% chase win rate (5/5). The counterintuitive zero-wicket record (66.7%) likely reflects cautious starts against tough targets. Once two or more wickets fall in the first six overs, the chase win rate collapses to 25-33%. The coaching staff should understand: the optimal chase profile is Salt or Kohli going hard, one falling to a good ball in the process, and the other carrying through with Patidar or V Iyer arriving at a comfortable situation.

**Who Scales and Who Doesn't**

| Batter | SR (≤160) | SR (161-180) | SR (180+) | Scales? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Virat Kohli | 136.6 | 146.5 | **162.9** | Yes, +26.3 across bands |
| Phil Salt | 190.0 | 189.1 | 184.0 | No, consistently elite regardless |
| Rajat Patidar | 120.8 | 145.0 | **169.4** | Yes, +48.6 across bands |

Kohli scales his strike rate precisely to the required rate: 136.6 against small targets, 162.9 when the chase demands it. At 37, the greatest chaser in IPL history still adjusts better than anyone else in this squad. Salt is the opposite: a flat 184-190 regardless of the target. He does not modulate. He attacks. The target is irrelevant. Patidar is the surprise: his SR jumps from 120.8 to 169.4 as targets increase, with sixes climbing from 1 per innings (≤160) to 1.8 per innings (180+). He is developing the range-hitting that RCB need from a number 3.

**2025 Chase Evolution**

The year-over-year trend tells a story of improvement:
- 2023: 2/5 (40.0%) chase wins
- 2024: 3/6 (50.0%)
- 2025: 6/7 (85.7%)

In 2025, every chase of 180 or below was won. The lone failure was a 231 target where RCB were bowled out for 189 (that death-overs collapse: 7 wickets in the final 5 overs at 4.55 SR). But they also chased down 227 against DC with 8 balls to spare, proving they *can* handle big targets when the top order fires together.

### What This Means for 2026

RCB should want to chase. The data is overwhelming: better batting SR (+12.0), better bowling economy when defending (-0.23), higher chase win rate (61.1% vs 53.8%), and individual player splits that uniformly favour chasing.

The tactical prescription is specific. If RCB restrict opponents to 180 or below, they should win. They are 8/8 in that scenario. The bowling unit's primary job is not to take 10 wickets; it is to ensure the target stays below 180. Everything about the squad composition, Bhuvneshwar and Hazlewood's powerplay stranglehold, Krunal's middle-overs control, the five all-rounders providing depth, supports a "restrict then chase" identity.

The vulnerability is equally specific. When opponents breach 200, RCB's middle order faces a structural problem: the pressure of a high required rate produces 3.1 wickets per chase in the middle overs, and death-overs collapses become terminal. The 2025 coaching staff addressed this partly through improved depth (Tim David, Jitesh Sharma), but the 200+ record (1/6) remains the statistical evidence that this squad has a ceiling when chasing.

If the coaching staff want one operational priority for 2026 chase preparation: train the middle order to survive the 8-15 over block when the required rate exceeds 10 per over. That is where chases die.

## Venue Analysis: M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru

The Chinnaswamy has a reputation as a batting paradise, the kind of ground where 180 feels par and bowlers take up meditation. The data since 2023 (19 matches) tells a slightly more interesting story.

**Chinnaswamy Phase Profile (Since 2023, aggregated across innings)**

| Phase | Run Rate | Boundary % | Dot Ball % | Wkts/Match |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 23.6% | 42.3% | 1.6 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 18.6% | 28.4% | 2.5 |
| Death | 11.25 | 24.7% | 28.7% | 2.4 |

**vs. League Averages (All Venues)**

| Phase | Chinnaswamy RR | League RR | Delta |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Powerplay | 9.09 | 9.26 | -0.17 |
| Middle | 9.29 | 8.76 | +0.53 |
| Death | 11.25 | 10.87 | +0.38 |

Here's the surprise: the Chinnaswamy actually plays *slower* than average in the powerplay. That batting paradise reputation? It's really a middle-and-death-overs paradise. The middle-overs run rate sits 0.53 above the league average, a meaningful deviation that explains why spin control is gold dust here. The death-overs run rate (11.25) is 0.38 above average, rewarding teams who can hit when it matters.

**How RCB's Strengths Fit the Venue:**
- The powerplay bowling (8.73 economy in 2025) should thrive on a ground where the powerplay is actually not as scary as everyone assumes
- Krunal Pandya's 7.45 middle-overs economy is 1.84 runs per over below the venue average in that phase. That's not a bowler; that's a force field
- Death batting (David, Jitesh, Kohli) is perfectly suited to the Chinnaswamy's elevated death-overs scoring
- The risk: if opponents target RCB's thin spin depth in the middle overs, the venue's elevated scoring rate will turn a problem into a crisis

## Head-to-Head Record

### Since 2023 (Current Form Window)

| Opponent | W-L | Win % | Key Pattern |
|----------|-----|-------|-------------|
| PBKS | 6-1 | 85.7% | One-sided enough to wonder what PBKS are doing differently |
| RR | 4-2 | 66.7% | RCB's pace depth tends to win the seam-on-seam battles |
| CSK | 3-2 | 60.0% | Spin matchups usually decide it. Somebody tell the middle order |
| DC | 3-2 | 60.0% | Tight margins. Venue often plays umpire |
| GT | 2-2 | 50.0% | Two bowling-first teams canceling each other out |
| LSG | 2-2 | 50.0% | RCB's middle-overs batting vulnerability gets exposed in the losses |
| MI | 2-2 | 50.0% | The great rivalry, now actually competitive again |
| SRH | 2-2 | 50.0% | SRH's aggression vs. RCB's bowling. Unstoppable force, moveable object |
| KKR | 1-4 | 20.0% | Narine and Varun Chakravarthy exploit RCB's off-spin gap relentlessly |

**Since 2023: 25-19 (56.8% win rate)**

### All-Time IPL (2008-2025)

| Opponent | W-L | Win % | Since-2023 W-L | Trend |
|----------|-----|-------|----------------|-------|
| PBKS | 19-18 | 51.4% | 6-1 | From coin-flip rivalry to total domination |
| DC | 19-14 | 57.6% | 3-2 | Historically RCB's best matchup among current teams |
| RR | 17-16 | 51.5% | 4-2 | Pace-on-pace battles now tilt RCB's way |
| KKR | 15-20 | 42.9% | 1-4 | Bad and getting worse. Spin is the recurring villain |
| MI | 14-20 | 41.2% | 2-2 | Long-standing deficit. Recent parity counts as progress |
| CSK | 13-21 | 38.2% | 3-2 | RCB's worst all-time record. Recent competitiveness is entirely new |
| SRH | 11-14 | 44.0% | 2-2 | Below .500 historically but balanced now |
| LSG | 4-2 | 66.7% | 2-2 | Small sample. Early dominance has leveled off |
| GT | 3-3 | 50.0% | 2-2 | Not enough data to mean anything yet |

**All-Time: 132-138 (48.9% win rate)**

**What the Numbers Say:**

The CSK and MI problem is ancient history. RCB's 38.2% and 41.2% all-time records against CSK and MI are the franchise's historical bruises. But since 2023, both matchups sit at 50-60%. The bowling-first identity has leveled what used to be lopsided rivalries. Think of it like a team that finally learned to defend set pieces: the old weaknesses no longer apply.

The KKR problem is alive and well. 1-4 since 2023 against a team RCB were already 15-20 against all-time. KKR's dual-spin attack (Narine + Varun Chakravarthy) finds RCB's off-spin gap in the middle overs like water finds a crack. Until that deficiency is genuinely addressed, every potential KKR playoff matchup should come with a health warning.

PBKS went from rival to afterthought. A historically dead-even rivalry (19-18) has become 6-1 since 2023. RCB's bowling transformation has simply overwhelmed PBKS's approach. This is no longer a competitive fixture.

## Players to Watch

### Phil Salt: The Human Powerplay

177.5 career strike rate across 595 balls (HIGH sample). Salt is among the most destructive openers in the IPL, and yet he doesn't get the spotlight because he plays alongside the most famous cricketer on the planet. In 2026, his role is existential: RCB's team powerplay SR of 154.1 needs a jolt, and Salt is the only player in this squad who can single-handedly provide it. Against fast-medium bowling, he strikes at 179.7 across 207 balls (HIGH). Against left-arm orthodox, 180.4 across 56 balls (MEDIUM). His numbers against pace are almost unfair. The one flag: 123.6 SR against leg-spin across 55 balls (MEDIUM). Teams with a quality leggie have a genuine route to muzzle him.

### Rajat Patidar: The Weight of the Crown

Patidar's numbers tell two very different stories. Against leg-spin, he's devastating: 225.0 SR across 72 balls (MEDIUM), treating leggies like bowling machine fodder. Against fast bowling, more mortal: 129.1 SR across 110 balls (MEDIUM). He's never captained at this level before, and he's taking charge of a team riding momentum. His recent form is the elephant in the room: 120.8 SR in his last 10 innings, down 39.9 points from his 160.7 since-2023 SR. If Patidar rediscovers even his average form, RCB's middle order strengthens considerably. If the captaincy weighs on his blade, the number 4 slot becomes the soft underbelly.

### Bhuvneshwar Kumar: The Man Holding the Building Up

At 36, Bhuvneshwar has no business still being this good. His 8.26 powerplay economy across 99 overs (HIGH) and 47.5% dot ball percentage in the powerplay are numbers most bowlers ten years younger would trade a limb for. He is RCB's only bowler who can reliably open an innings with genuine swing. But his death bowling, 10.96 economy across 48 overs (MEDIUM), tells the other story. His 22.2% dot ball rate at the death is among the lowest for frontline seamers. If he breaks down, there is no like-for-like replacement in this squad. None. Zero. Bhuvneshwar's fitness is, quietly, the single most important variable in RCB's entire season. It's the cricketing equivalent of a building's foundation: nobody notices it until it cracks.

### Krunal Pandya: The Man Who Makes the Highlights Possible

Krunal doesn't do viral moments. What he does is win matches while nobody's watching. His 7.45 economy in the middle overs across 82 overs (MEDIUM) is elite by any standard, and his 30.3% dot ball rate in that phase creates the pressure that makes the death-overs fireworks possible. His 25 middle-overs wickets are the most for any RCB bowler in that phase. But here's the stat that tells you everything: 12.0% boundary rate in the middle overs, compared to the 17.6% league average. He concedes boundaries at roughly two-thirds the rate of the average bowler. He's the reason the bowling-first identity works, and he has no understudy in this squad.

---

## Players Who Need to Step Up

**1. Devdutt Padikkal: The Middle-Overs Missing Piece**

RCB's middle-overs batting (143.9 SR in 2025) is their weakest offensive phase, and Padikkal (2.00 Cr, retained) has the toolkit to fix it. He's a left-hander who can bat at 3 or 4, and his 186.9 SR against fast bowling (MEDIUM, 99 balls) shows real stroke-play ability. The problem: 131.6 career SR and a recent form SR of 151.5 (last 10) that still sits below most starters. His 108.8 SR against left-arm orthodox (LOW, 34 balls) and 62.5 SR against wrist-spin (LOW, 8 balls) are developmental red flags. But if Padikkal can sustain his upswing and push for the XI, he gives the middle order something it currently lacks: a left-handed option who can actually bat.

**2. Kanishk Chouhan: The Cheapest Fix for the Biggest Problem**

RCB's off-spin depth chart is rated 1.4/10. That's not a typo. Chouhan (0.30 Cr, retained) is a 19-year-old uncapped off-spin all-rounder retained at a bargain price, which tells you two things: RCB know they have an off-spin problem, and Chouhan is the long-shot bet rather than a proven solution. He has zero IPL data, which makes any projection speculative at best. But he's the only player in the squad who can bowl off-spin to left-handers in the middle overs. If he can deliver even 2-3 overs per match at a sub-9 economy, it transforms RCB's options. If he can't, opponents with left-hand-heavy middle orders will keep exploiting overs 7-15.

**3. Suyash Sharma: Death Bowling Apprentice**

Suyash (2.60 Cr, retained) has carved out a comfortable niche as a middle-overs leg-spinner (8.78 economy, 13 wickets in 78 overs, MEDIUM). But his death bowling economy of 10.67 across 12 overs (LOW) is expensive, and with Yash Dayal's status uncertain and Bhuvneshwar's death bowling below par (10.96 economy), RCB need their young leggie to grow into a death-overs option. His 3 powerplay wickets at 7.33 economy (LOW, 3 overs) hint at versatility. The death overs remain the frontier he hasn't conquered yet.

## Recent Form

### Batters (IPL Recent Form)

| Player | Last 10 Inn | L10 Runs | L10 SR | Since-2023 SR | SR Delta | Trend |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Virat Kohli | 10 | 471 | 144.5 | 146.6 | -2.1 | Slight dip |
| Phil Salt | 10 | 301 | 180.2 | 177.5 | +2.7 | Stable-elite |
| Jitesh Sharma | 10 | 249 | 176.6 | 156.1 | +20.5 | Career-best form |
| Tim David | 10 | 187 | 183.3 | 166.8 | +16.5 | Above career |
| Venkatesh Iyer | 10 | 287 | 162.2 | 149.9 | +12.3 | Uptick |
| Romario Shepherd | 10 | 153 | 259.3 | 282.2 | -22.9 | Declining (small sample) |
| Devdutt Padikkal | 10 | 247 | 151.5 | 131.6 | +19.9 | Rebounding |
| Rajat Patidar | 10 | 151 | 120.8 | 160.7 | -39.9 | Steep decline |
| Krunal Pandya | 10 | 163 | 124.4 | 121.1 | +3.3 | Stable |

**What This Actually Tells You:** The form picture is sneakier than it looks at first glance. Kohli's recent 144.5 SR (last 10) is fractionally *below* his since-2023 average of 146.6. That's a slight dip, not the ascending trend his all-time numbers might suggest. The 37-year-old is still elite, but the trajectory is flat, not up. Jitesh (+20.5) and Tim David (+16.5) are the genuine upswings. Venkatesh Iyer's +12.3 delta makes him a well-timed acquisition. Shepherd's -22.9 looks alarming on paper, but with only 45 career balls, that's small-sample roulette rather than any real trend. The actual red flag, the one that should keep the coaching staff up at night, is Patidar: a -39.9 SR delta in his last 10 innings. That's the biggest negative swing in the entire squad. For a new captain, that's not a concern. That's an alarm bell.

### Bowlers (Individual Phase Economies, Since 2023)

| Player | Primary Phase | Econ (Primary) | Secondary Phase | Econ (Secondary) | Role |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Bhuvneshwar Kumar | PP | 8.26 (99 ov, HIGH) | Death | 10.96 (48 ov, MEDIUM) | Primary new-ball |
| Josh Hazlewood | PP | 7.54 (28 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 10.65 (15 ov, LOW) | Primary new-ball |
| Krunal Pandya | Middle | 7.45 (82 ov, MEDIUM) | n/a | n/a | Primary middle-overs |
| Suyash Sharma | Middle | 8.78 (78 ov, MEDIUM) | Death | 10.67 (12 ov, LOW) | Secondary middle-overs (leg-spin) |
| Yash Dayal | Overall | 9.85 (113 ov, HIGH) | PP / Death | 9.67 / 11.73 | Primary death (status uncertain) |

The individual numbers tell a sharper story than the team-level data. Hazlewood's 7.54 powerplay economy is a full 0.72 better than Bhuvneshwar's 8.26. He's the real ace; Bhuvneshwar is the very good king. Both become expensive at the death (10.65 and 10.96 respectively), confirming death bowling as the structural fault line. Krunal's 7.45 exists in its own postcode within this squad. And Yash Dayal's 11.73 death economy? That's the most concerning number in the entire bowling unit, made worse by the fact that nobody knows if he'll even be available.

## Interesting Data Insights

**1. Kohli's Death-Overs SR Is Real. But Read the Fine Print.**

Virat Kohli's 183.3 SR at the death across 114 balls (MEDIUM, 15 innings) ranks among the best in the squad. Sounds like a designated finisher, right? Not so fast. Kohli entered in the powerplay in all 44 of his innings since 2023. Every. Single. Time. He never walked in at the death as a pinch-hitter. His death-overs numbers come exclusively from batting through, meaning he only reaches overs 16-20 in 15 of 44 innings (34%). When he does bat at the death, he's already set, already in rhythm, already seeing it like a football. Compare that to Tim David, who enters specifically to hit from ball one with cold hands and fresh eyes. Both approaches are valuable. They are not the same skill, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest analysis.

**2. Patidar vs. Leg-Spin Is a Mismatch, and Not in the Bowler's Favor**

Rajat Patidar strikes at 225.0 against leg-spin across 72 balls (MEDIUM). That's the highest SR against any bowling type for any RCB batter with a meaningful sample. He's been dismissed just 3 times in those 72 balls, averaging 54.0. And here's the telling detail: his wrist-spin SR (smaller sample at 32 balls) drops to 112.5, suggesting he reads leg-spin *specifically* with unusual clarity, not wrist-spin in general. He's picking up the googly like he's got the answer sheet. Opposition captains: do not bowl your leggie to Patidar. You have been warned.

**3. Jitesh Sharma's Best Cricket Is Hiding Where It Matters Most**

Jitesh's recent form SR of 176.6 (last 10 innings) is 20.5 points above his since-2023 mark, but the real story lives in the phase breakdown. His 191.6 death SR across 178 balls (MEDIUM) is the highest among designated finishers in the RCB squad, above Tim David (184.6) and Kohli (183.3). At 11.00 Cr, Jitesh was an expensive retention that raised eyebrows. If his death-overs form continues, those eyebrows should be settling back down. A finisher who can also keep wicket is worth every rupee.

**4. Hazlewood's Dot Ball Rate Defies Logic**

Josh Hazlewood's 54.2% dot ball percentage in the powerplay (28 overs, MEDIUM) is borderline absurd. More than half of every delivery he bowls in the powerplay yields zero runs. For context, the team's overall powerplay dot ball rate is around 40-43%. Hazlewood isn't just economical; he's methodical, building dot-ball sequences that force batters into errors they wouldn't normally make. His 12 powerplay wickets in just 15 matches since 2023 are the direct consequence. Dot balls create pressure. Pressure creates wickets. Hazlewood creates dot balls. It's beautifully simple.

**5. The Left-Arm Pace Blind Spot Nobody's Talking About**

Yash Dayal is the only left-arm pacer in the predicted XII, and his availability is a question mark. Mangesh Yadav (left-arm fast, 6 matches) is the only backup, but his 12.33 powerplay economy (LOW, 6 overs) says he's not ready for that responsibility yet. If Dayal is unavailable, RCB loses all left-arm pace variation. That means opponents can stack right-handed batters without worrying about angle changes. It's like a football team losing its only left-footed defender: suddenly, everyone knows which way you're going.

---

## The Bold Take

**Virat Kohli is no longer RCB's most important player. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is.**

This will upset people. Good. The data is unambiguous. Kohli's 2,037 runs at 146.6 SR are extraordinary, but his powerplay SR (151.9) and middle-overs SR (134.2) are not pace-setting numbers. His elite contribution comes at the death (183.3 SR), but as we've established, that's a consequence of batting through, not a designated role. More importantly: take Kohli out of this team, and RCB's batting still has options (Salt, Patidar, Venkatesh Iyer, David, Padikkal). Take Bhuvneshwar out, and the bowling-first identity, the very thing that underpinned the 73.3% win rate in 2025, collapses like a house of cards. There is no backup swing bowler. There is no second powerplay specialist who can match his 8.26 economy. At 36, Bhuvneshwar Kumar isn't RCB's sentimental veteran. He is the foundation. His 47.5% powerplay dot ball rate is not replaceable by anyone in this squad. Full stop.

## By the Numbers

| Stat | Value | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| **8.73** | RCB's 2025 powerplay bowling economy | Down from 9.77 in 2024. A run-per-over improvement that rewired the entire franchise |
| **183.3** | Kohli's death SR (114 balls, MEDIUM) | Comes from batting through in 15/44 innings, not as a designated finisher |
| **-39.9** | Patidar's SR delta (last 10 vs since-2023) | The new captain's batting form is the squad's biggest concern |
| **7.45** | Krunal's middle-overs economy (82 overs, MEDIUM) | 1.44 runs per over below the league average. The invisible engine |
| **1.4 / 10** | Off-spin depth chart rating | No frontline off-spinner in the squad. Kanishk Chouhan (uncapped) is the only hope |

---

## Keys to Victory

**1. Bhuvneshwar Must Stay Fit for 14+ Matches**

RCB's bowling identity lives and dies with the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar powerplay partnership. Hazlewood, as an overseas player, may have availability windows. Bhuvneshwar, at 36, has managed workload concerns for years. If he misses more than 3-4 games, RCB's powerplay bowling economy could slide back toward the 9.77 wasteland of 2024. The franchise has no like-for-like replacement: Mangesh Yadav and Yash Dayal are not swing bowlers. This is the single biggest structural risk in the squad, and there's no auction buy that can fix it mid-season.

**2. The Middle Order Must Carry More Than 42-43% of Runs**

In 2025, RCB's top 3 (Kohli, Salt, and the third batter) scored the lion's share. With Venkatesh Iyer slotting in at 3, the middle order (Patidar at 4, David at 5, Jitesh at 6) needs to pick up more of the tab. Specifically, Patidar's -39.9 SR delta has to reverse. If the middle order can push toward 50-55% of the run contribution, it reduces the collapse risk that has haunted RCB since approximately forever.

**3. The Off-Spin Gap Cannot Be Wished Away**

The 1.4/10 off-spin depth rating isn't a quirk. It's a structural vulnerability that competent opposition coaches will identify within minutes of reviewing the squad list. Without a frontline off-spinner, RCB cannot create matchup advantages against left-handed batters in the middle overs. Kanishk Chouhan (0.30 Cr, uncapped) is the only internal option. If he delivers, brilliant. If he doesn't, opponents with left-hand-heavy middle orders (KKR, SRH, looking at you) will exploit this gap relentlessly. Krunal's left-arm orthodox is not a substitute for genuine off-spin. Different angle, different purpose.

**4. Overseas Slot Management Must Be Ruthless**

RCB has 7 overseas players: Salt, Hazlewood, David, Shepherd, Bethell, Duffy, and Cox. Only 4 can play. Salt (keeper-opener) and Hazlewood (lead seamer) are locked in. David (death finisher) is near-certain. The fourth slot is a genuine puzzle: Shepherd (pace AR), Bethell (batting AR with left-arm spin), or Duffy (pace depth). Getting this right, and being willing to rotate based on opposition rather than sentimentality, is what separates a good squad from a championship defence. The risk: falling in love with a combination and refusing to adapt.

## Andy Flower's Scouting Report

**Tactical Identity:** Bowling-first, death-finishing. RCB's game plan is to strangle opponents through overs 1-15 via the Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar-Krunal axis, then unleash batting firepower in overs 16-20. It's the cricketing equivalent of rope-a-dope: absorb, control, then strike.

**Structural Strengths:**
- Powerplay bowling (Hazlewood at 7.54 PP economy + Bhuvneshwar at 8.26) is among the best two-bowler pairings in IPL
- Middle-overs spin control (Krunal at 7.45 economy across 82 overs) is elite
- Death-overs batting depth (David 184.6 SR / 286 balls, Jitesh 191.6 SR / 178 balls, Kohli 183.3 SR / 114 balls) gives three separate threats
- Chinnaswamy's slightly below-average powerplay scoring rate suits the bowling attack

**Structural Vulnerabilities:**
- Off-spin and left-arm wrist-spin are effectively absent (1.4 and 1.3/10 depth ratings)
- Powerplay batting relies almost entirely on Salt
- Top 3 dependency (57.7% of runs in 2025) creates knockout-stage collapse risk
- Yash Dayal's off-field status creates left-arm pace depth uncertainty
- Bhuvneshwar's workload management at 36 is a season-long tightrope walk
- Death bowling economy (10.75 in 2025) remains the weakest bowling phase

**Opposition Blueprint:** Bowl off-spin and wrist-spin in the middle overs. RCB has no counter. Target Padikkal (62.5 SR vs wrist-spin, LOW sample but directional) and David (33.3 SR vs wrist-spin, LOW / 9 balls) if they play. Force Kohli into the middle overs where he strikes at 134.2 SR, materially below his powerplay (151.9) and death (183.3) rates. Avoid the powerplay bowling duel with Hazlewood-Bhuvneshwar at all costs. If chasing, do not let the game reach overs 16-20 with RCB needing less than 50. Their death batting is too deep to defend against.

**Matchup Targets:** Kohli's weakest bowling type matchup is right-arm off-spin at 101.9 SR (53 balls, MEDIUM). That's exploitable with a quality off-spinner. Tim David's wrist-spin vulnerability (33.3 SR, 9 balls) is a small sample but worth probing. Patidar's form slump (-39.9 SR delta) suggests he may be susceptible to early pressure if the new-ball bowlers can create doubt before he settles.

## Verdict

RCB in 2026 is a team that finally knows what it is. And in the IPL, self-knowledge is worth more than any auction paddle.

The bowling-first identity that delivered a maiden title in 2025 returns with its championship core intact, bolstered by Venkatesh Iyer's batting depth and Shepherd's death-overs chaos. If Bhuvneshwar stays fit, Patidar's form recovers, and the off-spin gap doesn't prove fatal, this is a top-4 squad with a genuine shot at back-to-back titles. If any of those three pillars wobble, the defending champions will learn what every champion eventually learns: winning it was the fun part. Keeping it is the real test.

**Projected Finish: 3rd-4th** | **Ceiling: Champions** | **Floor: 6th**
