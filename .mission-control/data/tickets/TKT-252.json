      "note": "AUDIT FINDINGS: (1) Stale keyboard hints: research-desk.html displayed Ctrl+Space (Autocomplete), Ctrl+L (Clear), and Ctrl+/ (Comment) in the editor shortcuts hint bar. These were remnants of the CodeMirror integration removed in TKT-174. Only Ctrl+Enter (Run) has a live JS handler. (2) Typewriter delay: index.html hero title 'The Lab' had a 4.8s animation-delay, originally synced to a now-disabled intro overlay animation (display:none !important). All other pages use 0.3s. (3) Dead CSS: 12 lines of CodeMirror override CSS (.cm-editor, .cm-editor.cm-focused, .cm-scroller) in research-desk.html — CodeMirror was removed but its style overrides remained."

      "note": "FIXES APPLIED: (1) research-desk.html: Removed stale Ctrl+L, Ctrl+/, Ctrl+Space hints. Kept Ctrl+Enter (Run) which has a live keydown handler. (2) research-desk.html: Removed 12 lines of dead CodeMirror CSS overrides (.cm-editor, .cm-focused, .cm-scroller). (3) index.html: Reduced typewriter animation-delay from 4.8s to 0.3s, typing duration from 1.2s to 0.8s, and adjusted blink-caret/hide-caret timings to match other pages. Hero title now appears in ~0.3s instead of ~4.8s."

      "note": "CONSERVATIVE NOTES: (1) Did NOT remove the disabled intro-overlay animation CSS block (~300 lines in index.html) — it is explicitly marked 'BACKLOG' with a TODO to revisit, so it is intentionally retained dead code. (2) Did NOT remove the .editor-shortcuts-hint CSS class definitions — they are still used by the simplified hint bar. (3) All other Lab pages (teams, artifacts, analysis, research, about) already had 0.3s typewriter delays — no changes needed. (4) Mission Control dashboard files had no stale hints or dead CSS related to this ticket."
