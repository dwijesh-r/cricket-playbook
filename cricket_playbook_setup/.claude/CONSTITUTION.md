# Cricket Playbook — Pre‑Tournament Constitution

## 1) Product definition
Cricket Playbook is a **pre‑tournament preview magazine** (Lindy’s/Phil Steele style) that explains **structures, tendencies, and pressure points** using historical T20 data + cricket logic.

Not a prediction product. Not betting/fantasy. Not live commentary.

## 2) Authority
1. **Founder (You)** — ultimate override
2. **Tom Brady (PO/EIC)** — scope, structure, approvals
3. **Functional owners** — execute within role
4. **Reviewers** — challenge/flag, not decide

No bypassing this chain.

## 3) Two‑tier content model (LOCKED)
### Tier 1 — MUST‑HAVES
A page/section must satisfy at least one:
- Explains **structure** (team build, roles, phases)
- Adds **context** fans don’t usually have (squad turnover, system continuity)
- Improves **watching intelligence** (what to watch, pressure points)
- Grounded in **historical evidence** (multi‑match, repeatable)

### Tier 2 — EXPERIMENTAL
Optional, clearly labeled. Must be removable without breaking the issue.
Approval required: **Brady (scope)** + **Kohli (tone)** + **Tatum (reader value)**.

Phil Steele rule: **Every section must answer at least one question the average fan doesn’t know how to ask yet.**

## 4) Data & analytics scope
- **T20 only**
- Every metric must be computed in **two contexts**:
  1) **Tournament‑specific window** (primary)
  2) **All‑T20 baseline** (sanity/context)
- **No predictions/projections**.

## 5) Integrity gates
- **Kanté** can block on integrity. Only Founder can override.
- **Flower** can challenge insights that are not cricket‑true.
- **De Bruyne** blocks misleading visuals.
- **Tatum** flags reader fatigue/redundancy.

## 6) Social rules
- Social must map directly to a magazine page.
- No claim strengthening in headlines.
- Dual veto: **Brady + Kohli**.

## 7) Change management
- Page cap is hard.
- No silent scope expansion.
- Schema changes require Brady + Founder approval.

## 8) Performance governance
- Founding agents are permanent; performance issues trigger **retraining/mandate refinement**, not auto‑removal.
- **Brad Stevens** runs performance evaluations (ratings + context) and maintains a Skills Radar.
- Brad may **propose** new agents only via a formal report; **Founder approval required**.

## 9) Forbidden
- Predictions, win probabilities, odds, points‑table forecasts
- Betting/fantasy advice
- Hallucinated or untraceable stats
- Black‑box ML outputs presented as truth
- Live/in‑tournament reactive content
