      intro: 'For a decade, watching RCB bowl was like watching someone parallel park a bus. Entertaining, occasionally heroic, but mostly just painful. That changed in 2025. The franchise that once treated bowling as something that happened between batting collapses posted a 73.3% win rate, won their maiden IPL title, and did it with a powerplay bowling attack that conceded over a run per over fewer than the league average.'

      text: 'RCB in 2026 is a team that finally knows what it is. And in the IPL, self-knowledge is worth more than any auction paddle. The bowling-first identity that delivered a maiden title in 2025 returns with its championship core intact, bolstered by Venkatesh Iyer\'s batting depth and Shepherd\'s death-overs chaos. If Bhuvneshwar stays fit, Patidar\'s form recovers, and the off-spin gap doesn\'t prove fatal, this is a top-4 squad with a genuine shot at back-to-back titles. If any of those three pillars wobble, the defending champions will learn what every champion eventually learns: winning it was the fun part. Keeping it is the real test.',

      claim: 'Virat Kohli is no longer RCB\'s most important player. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is.',
      argument: 'This will upset people. Good. The data is unambiguous. Kohli\'s 2,037 runs at 146.6 SR are extraordinary, but his powerplay SR (151.9) and middle-overs SR (134.2) are not pace-setting numbers. His elite contribution comes at the death (183.3 SR), but as we\'ve established, that\'s a consequence of batting through, not a designated role. More importantly: take Kohli out of this team, and RCB\'s batting still has options (Salt, Patidar, Venkatesh Iyer, David, Padikkal). Take Bhuvneshwar out, and the bowling-first identity, the very thing that underpinned the 73.3% win rate in 2025, collapses like a house of cards. There is no backup swing bowler. There is no second powerplay specialist who can match his 8.26 economy. At 36, Bhuvneshwar Kumar isn\'t RCB\'s sentimental veteran. He is the foundation. His 47.5% powerplay dot ball rate is not replaceable by anyone in this squad. Full stop.'

Bhuvneshwar, at 36, has managed workload concerns for years. If he misses more than 3-4 games, RCB\'s powerplay bowling economy could slide back toward the 9.77 wasteland of 2024. The franchise has no like-for-like replacement: Mangesh Yadav and Yash Dayal are not swing bowlers.

Without a frontline off-spinner, RCB cannot create matchup advantages against left-handed batters in the middle overs. Suyash Sharma\'s leg-spin and Krunal\'s left-arm orthodox give RCB two spin axes, but neither turns the ball into a left-hander the way an off-spinner does. Opponents with left-hand-heavy middle orders (KKR, SRH) will exploit this gap. Krunal\'s left-arm orthodox is not a substitute for genuine off-spin. Different angle, different purpose.'

Getting this right, and being willing to rotate based on opposition rather than sentimentality, is what separates a good squad from a championship defence. The risk: falling in love with a combination and refusing to adapt.'

Their death batting is too deep to defend against.',
      matchupTargets: 'Kohli\'s weakest bowling type matchup is right-arm off-spin at 101.9 SR (53 balls, MEDIUM). That\'s exploitable with a quality off-spinner. Tim David\'s wrist-spin vulnerability (33.3 SR, 9 balls) is a small sample but worth probing.

Take Noor Ahmad out and the 7.90 middle-overs economy across 102 overs is irreplaceable. Rahul Chahar (8.01 econ) is a backup, not a substitute — his wicket-taking rate is roughly half. Without Noor Ahmad, death bowling loses its only sub-8.0 option. The entire bowling strategy evaporates. His 48 wickets in 37 matches (1.3 per match) is among the highest for any spinner in the league. CSK\'s season rises and falls with a 20-year-old from Afghanistan.'

His 142.5 middle-overs SR is adequate, not explosive, but the low dot rate means the scoring never stalls.
