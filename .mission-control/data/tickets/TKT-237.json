Features: 7 category pill navigation, subcategory drill-down, sortable leaderboard tables, player search (Ctrl+K), pagination (25 per page), gold/silver/bronze rank badges, composite score bars with tier coloring (elite/strong/solid/average), mobile card layout, dark/light theme, methodology footnote explaining all composite formulas. Rankings nav link added to all 8 Lab pages (desktop nav-tabs + mobile nav menus).",

Composite methodology footnote accurately describes the weighting system from config/thresholds.yaml. Jose: Data loads from rankings.js (86.9 KB) without errors. Jayson Tatum: Responsive layout works on mobile with card view. Nav consistency achieved across all pages.",

In batting, the top-4 (Klaasen 86.9, Pooran 86.2, SKY 84.0, Head 83.2) are separated by just 3.7 points, suggesting a much more competitive batter landscape.",

      "usp": "First interactive player ranking leaderboard for IPL analytics. Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K search, arrow keys for category navigation) and tier visualization make this a scouting tool, not just a stat table."
