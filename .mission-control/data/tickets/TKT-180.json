  "title": "Mobile-First Film Room: Lightweight DuckDB Strategy",
  "state": "DONE",
  "priority": "P0",
  "progress_pct": 100,
  "description": "The Film Room currently blocks mobile users entirely because loading 15 Parquet tables into DuckDB-WASM exceeds mobile browser memory limits (~300-500MB). This is unacceptable — mobile is our primary audience. Investigate and implement a strategy to serve the Film Room on mobile. Options to evaluate: (1) Progressive/on-demand table loading — load dim tables first, fetch fact_ball only when needed. (2) Pre-computed results — generate static JSON for the 20+ example queries + common NL patterns, serve instantly without DuckDB. (3) Reduce data footprint — IPL-only fact_ball, columnar subsetting. (4) DuckDB httpfs — query remote Parquet files without loading into memory. (5) Hybrid — pre-computed for common queries, lightweight DuckDB for custom SQL. Success criteria: Film Room loads and serves useful results on mobile Chrome/Safari without crashing.",
