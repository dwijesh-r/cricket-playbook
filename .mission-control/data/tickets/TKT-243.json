      "step": "Root Cause Analysis",
      "note": "The original concern likely arose from either: (1) an incorrect assumption of a 90 Cr cap (the PRD task description used 90 Cr, but the actual IPL 2026 auction purse is 120 Cr as confirmed in The Lab dashboard code), or (2) MI and RR being among the highest spenders in the predicted XII without explicit cap enforcement. The generator script (generate_predicted_xii.py) has NO salary cap constraint — it checks overseas limit, bowling coverage, wicketkeeper, and spinner presence, but zero salary enforcement."

      "timestamp": "2026-02-15T12:00:00Z",
      "agent": "Stephen Curry",
      "step": "Generator Script Gap",
      "note": "The SUPER SELECTOR v3.0 generator (scripts/generators/generate_predicted_xii.py) enforces constraints C1-C6 (overseas, bowling, keeper, spinner) but has no salary cap constraint. This is acceptable because: (1) predicted XIIs are drawn from the team's own squad, which already passed auction cap checks at purchase time, (2) the XII cannot exceed squad total spend since all 12 players are from the same squad, (3) all 10 teams are under 120 Cr. However, a defensive audit check could be added in future."

      "note": "RR's 119.30 Cr XII spend (99.4% of cap) reveals an aggressive roster construction strategy: Jaiswal (18), Jurel (14), Parag (14), Jadeja (17.5), Archer (12.5), Hetmyer (11), Sam Curran (10), and Bishnoi (7.2) are all high-price acquisitions. RR's approach is to concentrate spend on 8 premium players and fill 4 positions cheaply (Sooryavanshi 1.1, Burger 3.5, Sandeep 4.0, Deshpande 6.5). This mirrors CSK's historical strategy of backing star performers, but leaves zero margin for mid-season roster adjustments. MI similarly invested in 4 marquee players at 16+ Cr each (Bumrah 18, SKY 16.35, Hardik 16.35, Rohit 16.3) while finding value in uncapped/low-cost overseas options (de Kock 1.0, Rutherford 0.5, Markande 0.3)."
