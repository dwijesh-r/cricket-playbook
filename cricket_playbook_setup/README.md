# Cricket Playbook — Agent Setup

This zip contains the current tuned agent files and guardrails for a pre-tournament cricket preview magazine.

## Files you tune most often
- `.claude/CONSTITUTION.md`
- `.claude/MAGAZINE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `.claude/METRIC_PACK.md`
- `.claude/agents/*.agent.md`

## Suggested next step (Option A)
Wire a minimal repo + GitHub Actions ingestion workflow so Brock can run Cricsheet ingestion and produce artifacts for Kanté/Curry.
